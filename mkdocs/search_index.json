            "text": "Setting things up\n\n\nBefore proceeding to install PYBOSSA, you will need to configure some other applications and libraries in your system. In this page, you will get a step by step guide on how to install all the required packages and libraries for PYBOSSA using the latest \nUbuntu Server Long Term Support\n version available at the moment:\n\n\n\n\nUbuntu 18.04 LTS\n\n\n\n\nPYBOSSA hosted servers\nCheckout Scifabric\ns \nhosted PYBOSSA servers\n.\nInstalling git - a distributed version control system\n\n\nPYBOSSA uses the \ngit\n distributed version control\nsystem for handling the PYBOSSA server source code as well as the\ntemplate projects.\n\n\nGit\n is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to extensive projects with speed and efficiency.\n\n\nTo install the software, all you have to do is:\n\n\n1\nsudo apt-get install git-core\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling the PostgreSQL database\n\n\nPostgreSQL\n is a powerful, open source\nobject-relational database system. It has more than 15 years of active\ndevelopment and a proven architecture that has earned it a strong\nreputation for reliability, data integrity, and correctness.\n\n\nPYBOSSA uses \nPostgreSQL\n as the main\ndatabase for storing all the data. To install it follow the next steps:\n\n\n1\nsudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-server-dev-all libpq-dev python-psycopg2 libsasl2-dev libldap2-dev libssl-dev\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling virtualenv (optional, but recommended)\n\n\nWe recommend installing PYBOSSA using a\n\nvirtualenv\n as it will create a\nan isolated Python environment, helping you to manage different\ndependencies and versions without having to deal with root permissions\nin your server machine.\n\n\nvirtualenv\n creates an\nenvironment that has its installation directories that doesn\nt\nshare libraries with other virtualenv environments (and optionally\ndoesn\nt access the globally installed libraries either).\n\n\nYou can install the software if you want at the system level if you have root privileges; however, this may lead to broken dependencies in the OS for all your Python packages, so if possible, avoid this solution and use the [virtualenv]\nhttp://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv\n) solution.\n\n\nInstalling \nvirtualenv\n in the\nUbuntu server:\n\n\n1\nsudo apt-get install python-virtualenv\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter installing the software you will be able to create independent virtual environments for the PYBOSSA installation as well as for the template projects. \n\n\nInstalling the PYBOSSA Python requirements\n\n\nInstalling the required libraries for PYBOSSA is a step that will need to use some compilers and dev libraries to work. Thus, you will need to install the following packages:\n\n\n1\n2\nsudo apt-get install python-dev build-essential libjpeg-dev libssl-dev libffi-dev\nsudo apt-get install dbus libdbus-1-dev libdbus-glib-1-dev libldap2-dev libsasl2-dev\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, you are ready to download the code and install the required\nlibraries for running PYBOSSA.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nWe recommend you to install the required libraries using a \nvirtual environment\n with the command virtualenv (you can install the package python-virtualenv). This will allow having all the libraries for PYBOSSA in one folder of your choice, so cleaning the installation would be as simple as deleting that folder without affecting your system.\n\n\n\n\nIf you decide to use a \nvirtualenv\n then, follow these steps (lines\nstarting with \n#\n are comments):\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n# get the source code\n\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/Scifabric/pybossa\n\n# Access the source code folder\n\n\ncd\n pybossa\nvirtualenv env\n\n# Activate the virtual environment\n\n\nsource\n env/bin/activate\n\n# Upgrade pip to latest version\n\npip install -U pip\n\n# Install the required libraries\n\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOtherwise, you should be able to install the libraries in your system\nlike this:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n# get the source\n\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/Scifabric/pybossa\n\n# Access the source code folder\n\n\ncd\n pybossa\n\n# Upgrade pip to latest version\n\npip install -U pip\n\n# Install the required libraries\n\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nVim\n editor is a very popular text editor for GNU/Linux systems, however, it\nmay be difficult for some people if you have never used it before.\nThus, if you want to try another and much simpler editor for editing\nthe configuration files you can use the \nGNU\nNano\n editor.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a settings file and enter your SQLAlchemy DB URI (you can also\noverride default settings as needed):\n\n\n1\n2\n3\ncp settings_local.py.tmpl settings_local.py\n\n# now edit ...\n\nvim settings_local.py\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nAlternatively, if you want your config elsewhere or with different name:\ncp settings_local.py.tmpl \n/my/config/file/somewhere\n\nexport PYBOSSA_SETTINGS=/my/config/file/somewhere.\n\n\n\n\nCreate the alembic config file and set the sqlalchemy url to point to\nyour database:\n\n\n1\n2\n    cp alembic.ini.template alembic.ini\n    \n# now set the sqlalchemy.url ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling Redis\n\n\nPYBOSSA uses Redis not only for caching objects\nand speed up the site, but also for limiting the usage of the API\nrequests.\n\n\nYou can install the latest Redis version downloading the package directly from its official \nsite\n site. Since Ubuntu 14.04 you can also, use the internal package:\n\n\n1\nsudo apt-get install redis-server\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have downloaded it and installed it, you will need to run two\ninstances:\n\n\n\n\nRedis-server\n: as a master node, accepting read and write\n  operations.\n\n\nRedis-sentinel\n: as a sentinel node, to configure the master and\n  slave Redis nodes.\n\n\n\n\nServer\n\n\nIf you have installed the server via your distribution package system,\nthen, the server will be running already. If this is not the case, check\nthe official documentation of \nRedis\n to configure it\nand run it. The default values should be OK.\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nPlease, make sure that you are running version \n= 2.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nIf you have installed the software using the source code, then, check the contrib folder, as there is a specific folder for Redis with init.d  start scripts. You only have to copy that file to /etc/init.d/ and adapt it to your needs.\n\n\n\n\nSentinel\n\n\nYou can run Redis in sentinel mode with the \nsentinel\n arg, or by its command named: redis-sentinel. This will vary from your distribution and version of Redis, so check its help page to know how you can run it.\n\n\nIn any case, you will need to run a sentinel node, as PYBOSSA uses it to load-balance the queries, and also to autoconfigure the master and\nslaves automagically.\n\n\nTo run PYBOSSA, you will need first to configure a Sentinel node. Create a config file named \nsentinel.conf\n with something like\nthis:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\nsentinel monitor mymaster 127.0.0.1 6379 2\nsentinel down-after-milliseconds mymaster 60000\nsentinel failover-timeout mymaster 180000\nsentinel parallel-syncs mymaster 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the contrib folder, you will find a file named \nsentinel.conf\n that\nshould be enough to run the sentinel node. Thus, for running it:\n\n\n1\nredis-server contrib/sentinel.conf --sentinel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nPlease, make sure that you are running version \n= 2.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nIf you have installed the software using the source code, then, check the contrib folder, as there is a specific folder for Redis with init.d   start scripts. You only have to copy that file to /etc/init.d/ and adapt it to your needs.\n\n\n\n\nSpeeding up the site\n\n\nPYBOSSA comes with a cache system that \nis disabled by default\n. PYBOSSA uses the \nRedis\n server to cache some objects like projects, statistics, etc. The system uses the \nSentinel\n feature of \nRedis\n, so you can have several master/slave nodes configured with \nSentinel\n, and your PYBOSSA server will use them \nautomagically.\n\n\nEnabling the cache\n\n\nOnce you have started your master Redis-server to accept connections, Sentinel will manage it and its slaves. If you add a slave, Sentinel will find it and start using it for load-balancing queries in PYBOSSA Cache system.\n\n\nFor more details about \nRedis\n and\n\nSentinel\n, please, read the official\n\ndocumentation\n.\n\n\nIf you want to disable it, you can do it with an environment variable:\n\n\n1\nexport\n \nPYBOSSA_REDIS_CACHE_DISABLED\n=\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen start the server, and nothing will be cached.\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nWe highly recommend you not to disable the cache, as it will boost the performance of the server caching SQL queries as well as page views. If you have lots of projects with hundreds of tasks, you should enable it.\n\n\n\n\nRunning asynchronous tasks in the background\n\n\nPYBOSSA uses the Python libraries \nRQ\n and\n\nRQScheduler\n to allow slow or\ncomputationally-heavy tasks to be run in the background in an\nasynchronous way.\n\n\nSome of the tasks are run on a periodic, scheduled, basis, like the\nrefreshment of the cache and notifications sent to users, while others, like the sending of emails, are created in real time, responding to events that may happen inside the PYBOSSA server (i.e. sending an email with a recovery password).\n\n\nTo allow all this, you will need two additional Python processes to run in the background: the \nworker\n and the \nscheduler\n. The scheduler will create the periodic tasks while other tasks will be generated dynamically. The worker will process each of them.\n\n\nTo run the scheduler, just run the following command in a terminal:\n\n\n1\nrqscheduler --host IP-of-your-redis-master-node\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, to get the tasks done by the worker, run:\n\n\n1\npython app_context_rqworker.py scheduled_jobs super high medium low email maintenance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also recommend using \nsupervisor\n\nfor simply running these processes with a single command.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nPYBOSSA relies on the scheduler and the worker for the normal functioning of the server, so make sure you run both services.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring the DataBase\n\n\nYou need first to add a user to your \nPostgreSQL\n database:\n\n\n1\n2\nsudo su postgres\ncreateuser -d -P pybossa\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse password \ntester\n when prompted.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou should use the same username that you have used in the\nsettings_local.py and alembic.ini files.\n\n\n\n\nAfter running the last command, you may also have to answer to these questions:\n\n\n\n\nShall the new role be a super user? Answer \nn\n (press the \nn\n\n  key).\n\n\nShall the new role be allowed to create databases? Answer \ny\n\n  (press the \ny\n key).\n\n\nShall the new role be allowed to create more new roles? Answer \nn\n\n  (press the \nn\n key).\n\n\n\n\nAnd now, you can create the database:\n\n\n1\ncreatedb pybossa -O pybossa\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, exit the postgresql user:\n\n\n1\nexit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, populate the database with its tables:\n\n\n1\npython cli.py db_create\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun the web server:\n\n1\npython run.py\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen in your web browser the following URL: \nhttp://localhost:5000\n\n\nAnd if you see the following home page, then, your installation has been\ncompleted:\n\n\n\n\nUpdating PYBOSSA\n\n\nPYBOSSA v2.9.0 starts using JSONB data type format within the PostgreSQL database. The upgrade should not break anything,\nbut be aware that all the materalized views will need to be dropped. This is required because some of these views use\nthe info field and we cannot migrate to JSONB without recreating them.\n\n\nThus, be sure to take a full backup before upgrading of your database. Then, delete all your materialized views that create a conflict (by default\nPYBOSSA handles the basic ones, but if you have created your own leaderboards, this will not be handled by the script). \n\n\nRun the migration (see next section) and re-create your materialized views. Most of these views are automatically handled by the background\njobs, so all of them should be recreated by the system without your intervention.\n\n\nUpdating PYBOSSA core and migrating the database table structure\n\n\nSometimes, the PYBOSSA developers add a new column or table to the PYBOSSA server, forcing you to carry out a \nmigration\n of the\ndatabase. PYBOSSA uses \nAlembic\n for performing the migrations, so in case that your production server needs to upgrade the DB structure to a new version, all you have to do is to:\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\ngit pull origin master\npip install -U pip\npip install -U -r requirements.txt\nalembic upgrade head\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first command will get you the latest source code. The second command updates the libraries. Finally, Alembic upgrades the database structure.\n\n\nVery occasionally, updates to the core system will also be required. For example, updating \npybossa.js\n in your PYBOSSA theme. To update the default theme, you can do this:\n\n\n1\n2\ncd\n home/pybossa/pybossa/themes/default\ngit pull origin master\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you are using the \nvirtualenv\n be sure to activate it before running the \nAlembic\n upgrade command.\n\n\n\n\nMigrating Your Old DB Records\n\n\nIn versions before v0.2.3, the default supported option for the \nlong_description\n field in projects was HTML. In new versions of PYBOSSA, the default option is Markdown. However, you can use HTML instead of Markdown by modifying the default PYBOSSA theme or using your own forked from the default one.\n\n\nIf you were have been using PYBOSSA for a while you might have projects in your database whose \nlong_description\n is in HTML format. Hence, if you are using the default theme for PYBOSSA, you will no longer see them rendered as HTML and may have some issues.\n\n\nTo avoid this, you can run a simple script to convert all the\nDB project\ns \nlong_description\n field from HTML to Markdown, just by\nrunning the following commands:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\npip install -U pip\npip install -U -r requirements.txt\npython cli.py markdown_db_migrate\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first command will install a Python package that will handle the\nHTML to Markdown conversion, while the second one will convert your DB\nentries.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nAs always, if you are using the \nvirtualenv\n be sure to activate it before running the pip install command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe latest version of PYBOSSA requires PostgreSQL \n= 9.3 as it is using materialized views for the dashboard. This feature is only available from PostgreSQL 9.3, so please upgrade the DB as soon as possible. For more information about upgrading the PostgreSQL database check this \npage\n.",

Create a settings file and enter your SQLAlchemy DB URI (you can also\noverride default settings as needed):  1\n2\n3 cp settings_local.py.tmpl settings_local.py # now edit ... \nvim settings_local.py    Note  Alternatively, if you want your config elsewhere or with different name:\ncp settings_local.py.tmpl  /my/config/file/somewhere \nexport PYBOSSA_SETTINGS=/my/config/file/somewhere.

            "text": "Configuring PYBOSSA\n\n\nThe PYBOSSA \nsettings_local.py.tmpl\n file has all the available configuration options for your server. This section, explains each of them and how you should/could use them on your server.\n\n\nOfficial support\n\n\nIf you need help configuring your PYBOSSA server, \ncontact us\n.\nWe offer official support and we would love to work with your PYBOSSA server.\n\n\nDebug mode\n\n\nThe \nDEBUG\n mode is disabled by default in the configuration file, as this should be only used when you are running the server for development purposes. You should not enable this option unless you need to do some debugging in the PYBOSSA server.\n\n\nDebug Toolbar\n\n\nPYBOSSA includes a flag to enable a debug toolbar that can give you more insights about the performance of PYBOSSA. We strongly recommend keeping the toolbar disabled in production environments, as it will slow down considerably all the execution of the code. However, if you are testing the server, feel free to enable it adding the following variable to the settings file:\n\n\n1\nENABLE_DEBUG_TOOLBAR\n \n=\n \nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfiling\n\n\nPYBOSSA installs \nFlask-Profiler\n, an extension that allows you to know which endpoints are being called, and how much time it\ntakes for them to process each request. You can enable it by setting this config variable in the settings_local.py file:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\nFLASK_PROFILER\n \n=\n \n{\n\n    \nenabled\n:\n \nTrue\n,\n\n    \nstorage\n:\n \n{\n\n        \nengine\n:\n \nsqlite\n\n    \n},\n\n    \nbasicAuth\n:{\n\n        \nenabled\n:\n \nTrue\n,\n\n        \nusername\n:\n \nadmin\n,\n\n        \npassword\n:\n \nadmin\n\n    \n},\n\n    \nignore\n:\n \n[\n\n        \n^/static/.*\n\n    \n]\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you can access the profiling page: http://server/flask-profiler/.\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nBe sure to use a strong password to protect this view as well as HTTPS.\n\n\n\n\nHost and Port\n\n\nThe \nHOST\n and \nPORT\n config variables can be used to force the server to listen on specific addresses of your server, as well as at a given port. Usually, you will only need to uncomment the \nHOST\n variable to listen on all the network interfaces.\n\n\nSecuring the server\n\n\nPYBOSSA uses the \nFlask Sessions\n feature that signs the cookies cryptographically for storing information. This improves the security of the server, as the user could look at the contents of the cookie but not modify it, unless they know the \nSECRET\n and \nSECRET_KEY\n.\n\n\nTherefore, \nit is essential that you create a new SECRET and\nSECRET_KEY keys for your server and keep them private\n. Please, check the \nFlask Sessions\n documentation for instructions on how to create proper secret keys.\n\n\nEnsuring Anonymous IPs\n\n\nPYBOSSA uses CryptoPAn to anoymize the user\ns IPs when they participate as anonymous users. This is a feature that\ns mandatory, and you will have to create\na KEY for it, specially this one:\n\n\n1\nCRYPTOPAN_KEY\n \n=\n \n32-char-str-for-AES-key-and-pad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nBe sure to use a strong key to protect your user IPs.\n\n\n\n\nDatabase username and password\n\n\nPYBOSSA uses the \nSQLAlchemy\n SQL toolkit to access the DB. In the settings file, you only need to modify the name of the user, password and database name, so it fits your needs in the field SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI:\n\n\n1\nSQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI\n \n=\n \npostgresql://username:userpassword@localhost/databasename\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoad balancing SQL Queries\n\n\nIf you have a master/slave PostgreSQL setup, you can instruct PYBOSSA to use the slave node for load balancing queries between the master and slave node.\n\n\nFor enabling this mode, all you have to do is adding to the\nsettings_local.py config file the following:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\nSQLALCHEMY_BINDS\n \n=\n \n{\n\n    \nslave\n:\n \npostgresql://user:password@server/pybossadb\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\ns dangerous, so better sign this\n\n\nPYBOSSA uses the \nIt\ns dangerous Python library\n that allows you to send some data to untrusted environments but signing it. It uses a key that the server only knows and uses it for signing the data.\n\n\nThis library is used to send the recovery password e-mails to your\nPYBOSSA users, posting a link with a signed key that will be verified by the server. Thus, \nit is vital that you create a secure and private key for it in your configuration file\n. To do it, just modify the \nITSDANGEROUSKEY\n variable.\n\n\nCORS configuration\n\n\nBy default, PYBOSSA has the API endpoints configured with \nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin:\n*. However, you can change it to whatever you want via the config file. Take a look at the official documentation for \nFlask-CORS\n for all the available options.\n\n\nFine tuning CORS\n\n\nYou can fine tune the CORS of PYBOSSA:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\nCORS_RESOURCES\n \n=\n \n{\n\n    \nr\n/api/*\n:\n\n        \n{\n\n            \norigins\n:\n \n*\n,\n\n            \nallow_headers\n:\n\n                \n[\n\n                \nContent-Type\n,\n\n                \nAuthorization\n\n                \n],\n\n            \nmax_age\n:\n \n21600\n\n        \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou can customize as much as you want CORS. Check the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\n\n\nModifying the Brand name\n\n\nYou can configure your project with a different name, instead of the\ndefault one: PYBOSSA. You only need to change the string \nBRAND\n to the name of your organization or project.\n\n\nAdding a Logo\n\n\nBy default, PYBOSSA does not provide a logo for the server side, so you will have to copy your logo into the folder: \npybossa/pybossa/static/img\n. If the logo name is, \nmy_brand.png\n, the \nLOGO\n variable should be updated with the name of the file.\n\n\nMultiple languages\n\n\nBy default PYBOSSA only speaks English. However, the default theme comes with a few translations (Spanish, French, Italian, Japanese, Greek and German).\n\n\nYou can enable those translations (mostly user interface strings and\nactions) by doing the following: creating a symlink to the translations folders:\n\n\n1\n$ \ncd\n pybossa \n ln -s themes/default/translations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis step will enable the default translations of PYBOSSA for your server. We recommend using these translations with the default theme. If you use your theme, the best thing is to do your translation, (see \ntranslating\n), as you might want to name things differently on the templates.\n\n\nYou can disable/enable different languages in your config file\n\nsettings_local.py\n. For example, to remove French you can add this configuration to the settings file:\n\n\n1\n2\nLOCALES\n \n=\n \n[(\nen\n,\n \nEnglish\n),\n \n(\nes\n,\n \nu\nEspa\u00f1ol\n),\n\n           \n(\nit\n,\n \nItaliano\n),\n \n(\nja\n,\n \nu\n\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\n)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, you can always specify a different default locale using the\nfollowing snippet in the same settings file:\n\n\n1\nDEFAULT_LOCALE\n \n=\n \nes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nPYBOSSA tries first to match the user preferred language from their browser. This will work for anonymous users, while registered ones can specify the language they want using their user preferences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nAs an alternative way to allow anonymous users to \nforce\n a different language, PYBOSSA looks for a cookie named \nlanguage\n where it expects the key of any of the supported languages in the LOCALES list. You can use JavaScript to set it up.\n\n\n\n\nCreating a theme\n\n\nPYBOSSA supports themes. By default, it provides its theme that you can use, or if you prefer, you can adapt it to create yours. The default theme for PYBOSSA is available in the \npybossa-default-theme repository\n.\n\n\nTo create your theme, all you have to do is to fork the default\ntheme to your account, and then start modifying it. A theme has a simple structure:\n\n\n\n\ninfo.json: this file includes some information about the author,\n    license, and name.\n\n\nstatic: this folder has all the CSS, JavaScript, images, etc. In\n    other words, the static content.\n\n\ntemplates: this folder has the templates for PYBOSSA.\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, if you want to change the look and feel (i.e., colors of the\ntop bar) all you have to do is to modify the styles.css file of the\nstatic folder. Or if you prefer, create your own.\n\n\nHowever, if you want to modify the structure, let\ns say you want to\nchange the order of the elements of the navigation bar: the first item should be the about link, then you will have to modify the files included in the templates folder.\n\n\nAs you can see, you will be able to give a full personality to your own PYBOSSA server without problems.\n\n\nUsing SASS and minifying JavaScript\n\n\nPYBOSSA supports SASS thanks to Flask-Assets. If you want to compile SASS or SCSS, just add to your theme static folder a new one named: sass. Then, you can request the compiled version from the templates like this:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n{% assets filters=\nlibsass\n, output=\ncss/gen/yourcss.min.css\n,\n          \nsass/yourcss.scss\n%}\n    \nlink\n \nrel\n=\nstylesheet\n \ntype\n=\ntext/css\n \nhref\n=\n{{ ASSET_URL }}\n\n{% endassets %}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe same can be done for Javascript using the filter minjs:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n{% assets filters=\njsmin\n, output=\ngen/packed.js\n,\n          \ncommon/jquery.js\n, \nsite/base.js\n, \nsite/widgets.js\n %}\n    \nscript\n \ntype\n=\ntext/javascript\n \nsrc\n=\n{{ ASSET_URL }}\n/\nscript\n\n{% endassets %}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults page\n\n\nPYBOSSA allows you to present a results page for your server. Add a file named results.html to the home directory in the templates folder, and you\nll be able to show results about your project from one place:\n\n\n1\n \nhttp://server/results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding your Contact Information\n\n\nBy default, PYBOSSA provides e-mail, and a Twitter handle to show some contact information. If you want, you can change it to your e-mail and Twitter account. You can do it, modifying the following variables in the \nsettings_local.py\n file:\n\n\n1\n2\nCONTACT_EMAIL\n \n=\n \nyour@email.com\n\n\nCONTACT_TWITTER\n \n=\n \nyourtwitterhandle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\nYou can change and modify the \nTERMSOFUSE\n for your server, by overriding the provided URL that we use by default.\nYou can also modify the license used for the data, just change the\nDATAUSE link to the open license that you want to use.\n\n\nAdding Help page\n\n\nBy default, PYBOSSA provides a help endpoint where you can have your FAQ or similar information for your users. However, it\ns empty, as each project is unique. For adding that information, create in the theme folder: templates/help/ a file named \nindex.html\n and write your information in there. This will render the information under \nhttp://youserver.com/help/\n\n\nEnabling Twitter, Facebook and Google authentication\n\n\nPYBOSSA supports third-party authentication services like Twitter,\nFacebook and Google.\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nIf you want to enable Twitter, you will need to create an application in \nTwitter\n and copy and paste the \nConsumer key, and secret\n into the next variables and uncomment them:\n\n\n1\n2\nTWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY\n \n=\n \nyourkey\n\n\nTWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET\n \n=\n \nyoursecret\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis will also enable the Twitter task importer.\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nIf you want to enable Facebook, you will need to create an application on \nFacebook\n and copy and paste the \napp ID/API Key and secret\n into the next variables and uncomment them:\n\n\n1\n2\nFACEBOOK_APP_ID\n \n=\n \nyourappid\n\n\nFACEBOOK_APP_SECRET\n \n=\n \nyoursecret\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle\n\n\nIf you want to enable Google, you will need to create an application in \nGoogle\n and copy and paste the \nClient ID, and secret\n into the next variables and uncomment them:\n\n\n1\n2\nGOOGLE_CLIENT_ID\n \n=\n \nclientid\n\n\nGOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET\n \n=\n \nsecret\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReceiving e-mails with errors\n\n\nIf you want to receive an e-mail when an error occurs in the PYBOSSA server (webhooks, background jobs, etc.), uncomment the\n\nADMINS\n config variable and add a list of e-mails.\n\n\nBackground jobs error notifications\n\n\nYou can change the default behavior for receiving emails regarding failed background jobs. The two config variables are the following:\n\n\n1\n2\nFAILED_JOBS_MAILS\n \n=\n \n7\n\n\nFAILED_JOBS_RETRIES\n \n=\n \n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAILED_JOBS_MAILS instructs the system to send you a reminder after seven days if you have not solved the issue with the background job.\n\n\nFAILED_JOBS_RETRIES instructs the system to retry the job N times. By default is 3.\n\n\nEnabling Logging\n\n\nPYBOSSA can log errors to a \nfile\n or to a \nSentry\n server. If none of the above configurations are used, you will get the errors in the log file of the web server that you are using (i.e., in nginx the errors will be in /var/log/nginx/error.log).\n\n\nMail Setup\n\n\nPYBOSSA needs a mail server to validate new accounts, send\ne-mails for recovering passwords, etc. , so it is critical that you\nconfigure a server. Please, check the section \nMail setup\n in the config file for setting it.\n\n\nGlobal Announcements for the users\n\n\nSometimes you will need to send a message to all your users while they are browsing the server. For example, a scheduled shutdown for installing new hardware or a database migration.\n\n\nPYBOSSA provides a general solution for these announcements via the \nsettings_local.py.tmpl\n configuration file. The announcement feature allows you to send messages to the following type of users:\n\n\n\n\nAuthenticated users\n, basically all the registered users in the\n    server.\n\n\nAdmin users\n, all the users that are admins/root on the server.\n\n\nProject owners\n, all the users that have created one or more projects on the server.\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, let\ns say that you want to warn all your admins that a new configuration will be deployed in your system. In this case, all you have to do is to modify the \nANNOUNCEMENT\n variable to display the message for the given type of users:\n\n\n1\nANNOUNCEMENT\n \n=\n \n{\nroot\n:\n \nYour secret message\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is an example of the \nANNOUNCEMENT\n variable in the\n\nsettings_local.py.tmpl\n file, so you can quickly adapt it for your server. The announcement variable has a \nkey\n and an associated \nmessage*\n. The supported keys are:\n\n\n\n\nadmin\n: for admin users.\n\n\nuser\n: for all the registered users (even admins).\n\n\nowner\n: for all registered users that have one or more projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou can use a mix of messages at the same time without problems, so, for example, you can display a message for Admins and Owners at the same time.\n\n\n\n\nDisable email notifications\n\n\nWhen a PYBOSSA project publishes a blog post, users will get an email (and webpush notification if it is enabled) with the update.\n\n\nYou can disable this behavior with the following flag:\n\n\n1\nDISABLE_EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS\n \n=\n \nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCache\n\n\nBy default PYBOSSA uses Redis to cache a lot of data in order to serve it as fast as possible. PYBOSSA comes with a default set of timeouts for different views that you can change or modify to your own taste. All you have to do is modify the following variables in your settings file:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n# Project cache\n\n\nAPP_TIMEOUT\n \n=\n \n15\n \n*\n \n60\n\n\nREGISTERED_USERS_TIMEOUT\n \n=\n \n15\n \n*\n \n60\n\n\nANON_USERS_TIMEOUT\n \n=\n \n5\n \n*\n \n60\n \n*\n \n60\n\n\nSTATS_FRONTPAGE_TIMEOUT\n \n=\n \n12\n \n*\n \n60\n \n*\n \n60\n\n\nSTATS_APP_TIMEOUT\n \n=\n \n12\n \n*\n \n60\n \n*\n \n60\n\n\nSTATS_DRAFT_TIMEOUT\n \n=\n \n24\n \n*\n \n60\n \n*\n \n60\n\n\nN_APPS_PER_CATEGORY_TIMEOUT\n \n=\n \n60\n \n*\n \n60\n\n\nBROWSE_TASKS_TIMEOUT\n \n=\n \n3\n \n*\n \n60\n \n*\n \n60\n\n\n# Category cache\n\n\nCATEGORY_TIMEOUT\n \n=\n \n24\n \n*\n \n60\n \n*\n \n60\n\n\n# User cache\n\n\nUSER_TIMEOUT\n \n=\n \n15\n \n*\n \n60\n\n\nUSER_TOP_TIMEOUT\n \n=\n \n24\n \n*\n \n60\n \n*\n \n60\n\n\nUSER_TOTAL_TIMEOUT\n \n=\n \n24\n \n*\n \n60\n \n*\n \n60\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nEvery value is in seconds, so bear in mind to multiply it by 60 to have minutes in the configuration values.\n\n\n\n\nDisabling the Cache\n\n\nIf you want to disable the cache, you only have to export the following env variable:\n\n\n1\nPYBOSSA_REDIS_CACHE_DISABLED\n=\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRedis configuration\n\n\nYou can configure how you connect to Redis via the following config variables.\n\n\nRedis python prefix\n\n\n1\nREDIS_KEYPREFIX\n \n=\n \npybossa_cache\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRedis Sentinel\n\n\nSpecify where the Redis sentinel is listening.\n\n\n1\nREDIS_SENTINEL\n \n=\n \n[(\nlocalhost\n,\n \n26379\n)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRedis master\n\n\nSpecify the name of the master node.\n\n\n1\nREDIS_MASTER\n \n=\n \nmymaster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRedis DB\n\n\nSpecify the DB.\n\n\n1\nREDIS_DB\n \n=\n \n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRedis Socket timeout\n\n\n1\nREDIS_SOCKET_TIMEOUT\n \n=\n \n0.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRedis retry on timeout\n\n\n1\nREDIS_RETRY_ON_TIMEOUT\n \n=\n \nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRate limit for the API\n\n\nBy default, PYBOSSA limits the usage of the API with the following\nvalues:\n\n\n1\n2\nLIMIT\n \n=\n \n300\n\n\nPER\n \n=\n \n15\n \n*\n \n60\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose values mean that when a user sends a request to an API endpoint, a window of 15 minutes is open, and during those 15 minutes the number of allowed requests to the same endpoint is 300. By adding these values to your settings_local.py file, you can adapt it to your own needs.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nPlease, be sure about what you are doing by modifying these values. This is the recommended configuration, so do not change it unless you are sure.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring upload method\n\n\nPYBOSSA by default allows you to upload avatars for users, icons for\nprojects, etc. using the local file system of your server. While this is\nnice for small setups, when you need to add more nodes to serve the same content, this feature could become a problem. For this reason, PYBOSSA also supports cloud solutions to save the files and serve them from there correctly.\n\n\nLocal Uploader\n\n\nThe local uploader is configured by default. We recommend having a separate folder for the assets, outside the pybossa folder. In any case, for enabling this method use the following the config settings:\n\n\n1\n2\nUPLOAD_METHOD\n \n=\n \nlocal\n\n\nUPLOAD_FOLDER\n \n=\n \n/absolute/path/to/your/folder/to/store/assets/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRackspace Cloud Files\n\n\nPYBOSSA comes with support for Rackspace CloudFiles service, allowing you to grow the services horizontally. Supporting cloud-based system is as simple as having an account in Rackspace, and setting up the following config variables:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\nUPLOAD_METHOD\n \n=\n \nrackspace\n\n\nRACKSPACE_USERNAME\n \n=\n \nusername\n\n\nRACKSPACE_API_KEY\n \n=\n \napi_key\n\n\nRACKSPACE_REGION\n \n=\n \nregion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the server is started, it will authenticate against Rackspace and\nsince that moment, your PYBOSSA server will save files in the cloud.\n\n\nCustomizing the Layout and FrontPage text\n\n\nPYBOSSA allows you to override two items:\n- \nFront Page Text\n\n- \nFooter\n\n\nIf you want to override those items, you have to create a folder named \ncustom\n and place it in the \ntemplate\n dir. Then for replacing:\n\n\n\n\nThe Front Page Text\n: create a file named.\n  \nfront_page_text.html\n and write there some HTML.\n\n\nThe Footer\n: create a file named \n_footer.html\n, and write\n  some HTML.\n\n\n\n\nTracking the server with Google Analytics\n\n\nPYBOSSA provides an easy way to integrate Google Analytics with your PYBOSSA server. To enable it you only have to create a file with the name: \n_ga.html\n in the \npybossa/template\n folder with the Google Tracking code. PYBOSSA will be including your Google Analytics tracking code on every page since that moment.\n\n\nThe file \n_ga.html\n should contain something like this:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\nscript\n \ntype\n=\ntext/javascript\n\n  \nvar\n \n_gaq\n \n=\n \n_gaq\n \n||\n \n[];\n\n  \n_gaq\n.\npush\n([\n_setAccount\n,\n \nUA-XXXXXXXX-X\n]);\n\n  \n_gaq\n.\npush\n([\n_trackPageview\n]);\n\n\n  \n(\nfunction\n()\n \n{\n\n    \nvar\n \nga\n \n=\n \ndocument\n.\ncreateElement\n(\nscript\n);\n \nga\n.\ntype\n \n=\n \ntext/javascript\n;\n \nga\n.\nasync\n \n=\n \ntrue\n;\n\n    \nga\n.\nsrc\n \n=\n \n(\nhttps:\n \n==\n \ndocument\n.\nlocation\n.\nprotocol\n \n?\n \nhttps://ssl\n \n:\n \nhttp://www\n)\n \n+\n \n.google-analytics.com/ga.js\n;\n\n    \nvar\n \ns\n \n=\n \ndocument\n.\ngetElementsByTagName\n(\nscript\n)[\n0\n];\n \ns\n.\nparentNode\n.\ninsertBefore\n(\nga\n,\n \ns\n);\n\n  \n})();\n\n\n/script\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding a Search box: Google Custom Search\n\n\nPYBOSSA provides a simple way to search within the server pages: Google Custom Search. To enable it you will have to apply for a Google Custom Search API key and then follow the next steps:\n\n\n\n\nCopy the Google Custom Search \nscript\n code\n\n\nCreate a new file called \n_gcs.html\n in the templates folder\n\n\nPaste the previous snippet of code (be sure to delete the\n  \n; line from it.\n\n\nCopy the \n_gcs_form.html.template\n as \n_gcs_form.html\n and\n  add your key in the input field \ncx\n (you will find a text like\n  XXXXX:YYYY where you should paste your key).\n\n\n\n\nThe \n_gcs.html\n file will have something like this:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\nscript\n\n  \n(\nfunction\n()\n \n{\n\n    \nvar\n \ncx\n \n=\n \nXXXXX:YYYY\n;\n\n    \nvar\n \ngcse\n \n=\n \ndocument\n.\ncreateElement\n(\nscript\n);\n \ngcse\n.\ntype\n \n=\n \ntext/javascript\n;\n \ngcse\n.\nasync\n \n=\n \ntrue\n;\n\n    \ngcse\n.\nsrc\n \n=\n \n(\ndocument\n.\nlocation\n.\nprotocol\n \n==\n \nhttps:\n \n?\n \nhttps:\n \n:\n \nhttp:\n)\n \n+\n\n        \n//www.google.com/cse/cse.js?cx=\n \n+\n \ncx\n;\n\n    \nvar\n \ns\n \n=\n \ndocument\n.\ngetElementsByTagName\n(\nscript\n)[\n0\n];\n \ns\n.\nparentNode\n.\ninsertBefore\n(\ngcse\n,\n \ns\n);\n\n  \n})();\n\n\n/\nscript\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the \n_gcs_form.html\n will be like this:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n    \nform\n \nclass\n=\nnavbar-form\n \nstyle\n=\npadding-top:20px;\n \naction\n=\n/search\n\n          \ninput\n \ntype\n=\nhidden\n \nname\n=\ncx\n \nvalue\n=\npartner-pub-XXXXX:YYYYY\n/\n\n          \ninput\n \ntype\n=\nhidden\n \nname\n=\ncof\n \nvalue\n=\nFORID:10\n \n/\n\n          \ninput\n \ntype\n=\nhidden\n \nname\n=\nie\n \nvalue\n=\nISO-8859-1\n \n/\n\n          \ndiv\n \nclass\n=\ninput-append\n\n          \ninput\n \ntype\n=\ntext\n \nname\n=\nq\n \nsize\n=\n21\n \nclass\n=\ninput-small\n \nplaceholder\n=\nSearch\n  \n/\n\n          \nspan\n \nclass\n=\nadd-on\ni\n \nclass\n=\nicon-search\n \nstyle\n=\ncolor:black\n/\ni\n/\nspan\n\n          \n/\ndiv\n\n    \n/\nform\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter these steps, your site will be indexed by Google, and Google Custom Search will be working, providing for your users a search tool.\n\n\nAdding web maps for project statistics (deprecated since v2.9.5)\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nPYBOSSA does not support this feature anymore since version v2.9.5 as now\nit anonymizes the IPs (following GDPR EU law), so these maps don\nt make sense anymore.\nFor more info, check the \nGDPR\n section.\n\n\n\n\nPYBOSSA creates for each project a statistics page, where the creators of the project and the volunteers can check the top 5 anonymous and authenticated users, an estimation of time about when all the tasks will be completed, etc.\n\n\nOne exciting feature of the statistics page is that it can generate a\nweb map showing the location of the anonymous volunteers that have been participating in the project. By default, the maps are disabled, because you will need to download the GeoLiteCity DAT file database that will be used for generating the maps.\n\n\nGeoLite\n is a free geolocalisation database from MaxMind that they release under a\n\nCreative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Uported\nLicense\n. You can\ndownload the required file: GeoLite City from this \npage\n.\nOnce you have downloaded the file, all you have to do is to uncompress it and place it in the folder \ndat\n of the pybossa root folder.\n\n\nAfter copying the file, all you have to do to start creating the maps is\nto restart the server.\n\n\nUsing your Terms of Use\n\n\nPYBOSSA has a default Terms of Service page that you can customize it to fit your institutional needs. In the case that you do not want to use the default one, please, create a \n_tos.html\n file in the \ncustom\n folder. You can re-use the template  \nhelp/_tos.html\n and adapt it (it is located in the \ntemplate/help\n folder.\n\n\nUsing your Cookies Policy\n\n\nPYBOSSA has a default cookies policy page, but you can customize it to fit your institutional needs. In the case that you do not want to use the default one, please, create a \n_cookies_policy.html\n file in the \ncustom\n folder. You can re-use the template \nhelp/_cookies_policy.html\n and adapt it (it is located in the\n\ntemplate/help\n folder.\n\n\nUsing your Privacy Policy\n\n\nPYBOSSA has a blank privacy policy page. We recommend you to add one, so your users know how you are using their data. To add it, just create a file named \n_privacy_policy.html\n file in the \ncustom\n folder.\n\n\nExporting data to a CKAN server\n\n\nCKAN\n is a powerful data management system that makes data accessible \u2013 by providing tools to streamline publishing, sharing, finding and using data. \nCKAN\n is aimed at data publishers (national and regional governments, companies and\norganizations) wanting to make their data open and available.\n\n\nPYBOSSA can export project\ns data to a \nCKAN\n server. To use this feature, you will need to add the following config variables to the settings_local.py file:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n# CKAN URL for API calls\n\n\nCKAN_NAME\n \n=\n \nDemo CKAN server\n\n\nCKAN_URL\n \n=\n \nhttp://demo.ckan.org\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs \nCKAN\n is open source, you can install your own\n\nCKAN\n server and configure it to host the data generated by your PYBOSSA projects quite quickly, making it the data repository for your projects. Another alternative is to use the \nthe\nData hub\n service that it is a free CKAN service for hosting your data.\n\n\nEnforce Privacy mode\n\n\nSome projects sometimes need a way to protect their contributors due to their nature. In these cases, where privacy is critical, PYBOSSA allows you to \nlock\n all the public pages related to the users and statistics about the site and projects. Specifically,\nby enabling this mode, only administrators will be able to see the\nfollowing pages:\n\n\n\n\nhttp://server/stats\n\n\nhttp://server/account/\n\n\nhttp://server/account/user/\n\n\nhttp://server/project/stats\n\n\n\n\nAnonymous and authenticated will see a warning message like this:\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the footer and front page top users will be removed with links to all these pages. If your project needs this type of protection you can enable it by changing the following config variable in your \nsettings_local.py\n file from:\n\n\n1\nENFORCE_PRIVACY\n \n=\n \nFalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:\n\n\n1\nENFORCE_PRIVACY\n \n=\n \nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis feature is disabled by default.\n\n\n\n\nMaking extra key/value pairs in info field public\n\n\nBy default, PYBOSSA protects all the information the info field except for those values that are public like the URL of the image of the project, the container where that picture is stored and a few extra. While this will be more than enough for most projects, sometimes, a server will need to expose more information publicly via the info field for the User and Project Domain Objects.\n\n\nImagine that you want to give badges to users. You can store that\ninformation in the User domain object, within the info field in a field\nnamed \nbadges\n. While this will work, the API will hide all that\ninformation except for the owner. Thus, it will be impossible to show\nuser\ns badges to anonymous people.\n\n\nWith projects, it could be the same. You want to highlight some info to anyone, but hide everything else.\n\n\nAs PYBOSSA hides everything by default, you can always turn on which other fields from the info field can be shown to anonymous users, making them public.\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nBe very careful. If you expose your private data via this field, it\ns your responsibility as this is disabled by default in PYBOSSA.\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to make some key/values public, all you have to do is add them to the settings_local.py file the following config variables:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\nPROJECT_INFO_PUBLIC_FIELDS\n \n=\n \n[\nkey1\n,\n \nkey2\n]\n\n\nUSER_INFO_PUBLIC_FIELDS\n \n=\n \n[\nbadges\n,\n \nkey2\n,\n \n...\n]\n\n\nCATEGORY_INFO_PUBLIC_FIELDS\n \n=\n \n[\nkey1\n,\n \nkey2\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd as many as you want/need. But please, be careful about which information you disclose.\n\n\nAdding custom project templates\n\n\nPYBOSSA supports different types of templates that you can offer for\nevery project. By default, PYBOSSA comes with the following templates:\n\n\n\n\nBasic\n: the most basic template. It only has the necessary structure to develop your project.\n\n\nImage\n: this template is for image pattern recognition.\n\n\nSound\n: similar to the image template, but for sound clips\n  hosted on SoundCloud.\n\n\nVideo\n: similar to the image template, but for video clips\n  hosted on Vimeo or Youtube.\n\n\nMap\n: this template is for geocoding projects.\n\n\nPDF\n: this template is for transcribing documents.\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to add your templates or remove one, just create in the\nsettings_local.py file a variable named \nPRESENTERS\n and add remove the ones you want:\n\n\n1\nPRESENTERS\n \n=\n \n[\nbasic\n,\n \nimage\n,\n \nsound\n,\n \nvideo\n,\n \nmap\n,\n \npdf\n,\n \nyourtemplate\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyourtemplate\n should be a template that you have to save in the theme folder: \n/templates/projects/snippets/\n with the same name. Check the other templates to use them as a base layer for your template.\n\n\nAfter adding the template, the server will start offering this new template to your users.\n\n\nIn addition to the project templates themselves, you can add some test tasks for those projects so that the users can import them into their projects and start \nplaying\n with them or taking their format as a starting point to create their own. These tasks can be imported from Google Docs spreadsheets, and you can add them, remove them, or modify the URLs of the spreadsheets changing the value of the variable \nTEMPLATE_TASKS\n in settings_local.py:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\nTEMPLATE_TASKS\n \n=\n \n{\n\n    \nimage\n:\n\n    \nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsNlt0WgPAHwdHFEN29mZUF0czJWMUhIejF6dWZXdkE\nusp=sharing\n,\n\n    \nsound\n:\n\n    \nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsNlt0WgPAHwdEczcWduOXRUb1JUc1VGMmJtc2xXaXc\nusp=sharing\n,\n\n    \nvideo\n:\n\n    \nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsNlt0WgPAHwdGZ2UGhxSTJjQl9YNVhfUVhGRUdoRWc\nusp=sharing\n,\n\n    \nmap\n:\n\n    \nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsNlt0WgPAHwdGZnbjdwcnhKRVNlN1dGXy0tTnNWWXc\nusp=sharing\n,\n\n    \npdf\n:\n\n    \nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsNlt0WgPAHwdEVVamc0R0hrcjlGdXRaUXlqRXlJMEE\nusp=sharing\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting an expiration time for project passwords\n\n\nPYBOSSA allows the owner of a project to set a password so that only people (both anonymous or authenticated) that know it can contribute. By entering this password, the user will have access to the project for a time specified by:\n\n\n1\nPASSWD_COOKIE_TIMEOUT\n \n=\n \n60\n \n*\n \n30\n\n\n\n\n\nThis variable is configured by default to 30 minutes.\n\n\nValidation of new user accounts\n\n\nWhenever a new user wants to sign up, PYBOSSA allows you to add some extra security steps to the process by asking the users to validate a real email account.\n\n\nHowever, if you don\nt need this feature, it can be disabled (as it is enabled by default) with this configuration parameter:\n\n\n1\nACCOUNT_CONFIRMATION_DISABLED\n \n=\n \nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-factor authentication on login\n\n\nIf you need an extra layer of security for user authentication, PYBOSSA allows you to enable two-factor authentication by setting this configuration value:\n\n\n1\nENABLE_TWO_FACTOR_AUTH\n \n=\n \nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this parameter set, after password verification users will receive a one-time code in their email, and will be redirected to a page where they can insert the code to complete the login process.\n\n\nSending weekly email stats to project owners\n\n\nProject owners that have the pro-flag set to True can receive every week an update with the latest statistics about their projects in their email box.\n\n\nBy default, this email is sent every Sunday. You can modify it in the\nsettings file by changing it to another day:\n\n\n1\nWEEKLY_UPDATE_STATS\n \n=\n \nTuesday\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nFor the moment the only way to toggle the pro-flag is via the database. It will be fixed in the future.\n\n\n\n\nNewsletters with Mailchimp\n\n\nPYBOSSA can show a subscription page to users when they create an\naccount. By default is disabled.  You can enable it, revealing a page to recently registered users, to check if they want to subscribe or not.\n\n\nTo support newsletters, you\nll have to create an account in Mailchimp and get an API_KEY as well as a LIST_ID to add the users.\n\n\nOnce you have those two items you can enable the newsletter subscription adding them to your settings_local.py file:\n\n\n1\n2\nMAILCHIMP_API_KEY\n \n=\n \nyour-key\n\n\nMAILCHIMP_LIST_ID\n \n=\n \nyour-list-id\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart the server, and you will be done. Now in your MailChimp account, you will be able to create campaigns and communicate with your registered and interested users.\n\n\nEnabling the Flickr Task importer\n\n\nPYBOSSA has several different types of built-in importers. Users can use them to import tasks for their projects directly from the Web interface. However, using the Flickr one requires an API key and shared a secret from Flickr to communicate with the service.\n\n\nOnce you have an API key, you\nll have to add it to your settings_local.py file:\n\n\n1\n2\nFLICKR_API_KEY\n \n=\n \nyour-key\n\n\nFLICKR_SHARED_SECRET\n \n=\n \nyour-secret\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information on how to get a Flickr API key and shared secret, please refer to \nFlickr API documentation\n.\n\n\nEnabling the Dropbox Task importer\n\n\nPYBOSSA also offers the Dropbox importer, which allows importing all kind of files from a Dropbox account directly. To use it,\nyou\nll need to register your PYBOSSA server as a Dropbox app, as\nexplained \nhere\n.\n\n\nDon\nt worry about the Javascript snippet part; we\nve already handled that for you. Instead, get the App key you will be given and add it to\nyour settings_local.py:\n\n\n1\nDROPBOX_APP_KEY\n \n=\n \nyour-key\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnabling the Twitter Task importer\n\n\nIf you already have enabled the Twitter authentication, then the Twitter task importer will be enabled too. Otherwise, you will need to create an application in \nTwitter\n and copy and paste the \nConsumer key, and secret\n into the next variables and uncomment them:\n\n\n1\n2\nTWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY\n \n=\n \nkey\n\n\nTWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET\n \n=\n \nsecret\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis will also enable PYBOSSA\ns Twitter login.\n\n\n\n\nEnabling the Youtube\ns Task importer\n\n\nThe Youtube\ns task importer needs a Youtube server key which you need to create in the \nGoogle API Console\n in YouTube Data API.\n\n\nOnce you have an API key, you\nll have to add it to your\nsettings_local.py file:\n\n\n1\nYOUTUBE_API_SERVER_KEY\n \n=\n \nyour-key\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information on how to get a Youtube server key, please refer to \nthe official documentation\n.\n\n\nEnabling Server-Sent Events\n\n\nSince PYBOSSA v1.1.0, PYBOSSA supports Server-Sent Events (SSE) in some views. This feature is powerful. However, it brings some issues with it: it needs to run PYBOSSA in asynchronous mode.\n\n\nAs this is not a necessity, by default PYBOSSA has this feature\ndisabled. PYBOSSA uses SSE to notify users about specific actions (i.e., the result of a webhook in real time).\n\n\nIf you want to enable it, you will have to add to your settings_local.py:\n\n\n1\nSSE\n \n=\n \nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, you will need to configure uwsgi and nginx to support SSE events. This is not trivial, as there are several different scenarios, libraries, and options, so instead of recommending one solution, we invite you to read the \nuwsgi documentation about it\n, so you can take a decision based on your infrastructure and preferences.\n\n\nLatest news from PYBOSSA\n\n\nSince v1.2.1 PYBOSSA gets the latest news of its new releases, as well as anything related to what Scifabric blogs about regarding the crowdsourcing world. You can add more items if you want, by just adding to your settings_local.py file new ATOM URLs:\n\n\n1\nNEWS_URL\n \n=\n \n[\nhttp:/http:///atomurl1\n,\n \nhttp://atomurl2\n,\n \n...\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnabling pro user features\n\n\nSince version v1.2.2 PYBOSSA, you can specify which features can be only available to pro users or everyone. To modify them, just locate them in the settings_local.py file. By default, they look\nlike:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\nPRO_FEATURES\n \n=\n \n{\n\n    \nauditlog\n:\n              \nTrue\n,\n\n    \nwebhooks\n:\n              \nTrue\n,\n\n    \nupdated_exports\n:\n       \nTrue\n,\n\n    \nnotify_blog_updates\n:\n   \nTrue\n,\n\n    \nproject_weekly_report\n:\n \nTrue\n,\n\n    \nautoimporter\n:\n          \nTrue\n,\n\n    \nbetter_stats\n:\n          \nTrue\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy choosing \nTrue\n on each of them, you are making that specific feature available only to pro users. On the other hand, selecting \nFalse\n makes them available to regular users as well.\n\n\nStrict Slashes\n\n\nBy default, PYBOSSA distinguishes between two types of URLs for its\nendpoints: with and without a trailing slash. In other words, if an endpoint is not declared within the code as accepting both options,\naccessing the same endpoint with a trailing slash will return a 404.\n\n\nFor example, the about endpoint:\n\n\n1\nGET /about\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill return the page, but with the default configuration it will return\na 404 if you add a trailing slash to it:\n\n\n1\nGET /about/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo disable this behavior, enable the STRICT_SLASHES option and set it to False. That option will ensure that both endpoints work with and without the trailing slash.\n\n\nForums\n\n\nPYBOSSA does not provide its own forum. However, you can use Disqus and integrate it in your PYBOSSA server.\n\n\nDisqus Single Sign-On (SSO)\n\n\nPYBOSSA supports Disqus SSO. However, it is disabled by default. You need to register a Disqus application (see their \ndocumentation\n) and then update your settings_local.py file with the following two keys:\n\n\n1\n2\nDISQUS_SECRET_KEY\n \n=\n \nsecret\n\n\nDISQUS_PUBLIC_KEY\n \n=\n \npublickey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, this will enable you to use a new Jinja2 filter for  authenticating PYBOSSA users directly in their Disqus server. The filter is \ndisqus_sso\n. You can use it like this:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n{%\n \nif\n \ncurrent_user.is_authenticated\n()\n \n%}\n\n\n{{\n \ncurrent_user\n \n|\n \ndisqus_sso\n \n|\n \nsafe\n \n}}\n\n\n{%\n \nelse\n \n%}\n\n\n{{\n \nNone\n \n|\n \ndisqus_sso\n \n|\n \nsafe\n \n}}\n\n\n{%\n \nendif\n \n%}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, if you are building a Single Page Application, you can use our API endpoint: \napi/disqus/sso\n to get the credentials and authenticate the users within your javascript. Check the \nendpoint information Disqus-API\n.\n\n\nBackground jobs timeout\n\n\nBy default PYBOSSA timeout for every job is 10 minutes. In principle, it should be fine, but each project and server is unique, so if you start\nseeing too many jobs failing because the job timed out, then, increase the value using these config variables:\n\n\n1\n2\nMINUTE\n \n=\n \n60\n\n\nTIMEOUT\n \n=\n \n20\n \n*\n \n60\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeb Push notifications\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou need to have HTTPS enabled for your site. Otherwise, you will need to use a subdomain from onesignal.com to support this feature. If you cannot use HTTPS, we recommend to disable it.\n\n\n\n\nPYBOSSA can send web push notifications to Google Chrome, Mozilla\nFirefox and Safari browsers.\n\n\nFor supporting this feature, PYBOSSA uses the Onesignal.com service. You will need an account and create an app for your PYBOSSA server. Then follow their documentation to download the WebPush SDK and configure your PYBOSSA theme.\n\n\nFor more info regarding Onesignal, check their \ndocumentation.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou can host the SDK files in the static folder of your theme. However, you will need to modify your web server (Apache or Nginx) to serve those files as from the root of your server. If this is not done correctly, it will not work.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have created the app in Onesignal, get the API KEY and APP ID. Then copy them and put it in your settings_local.py file:\n\n\n1\n2\nONESIGNAL_APP_ID\n \n=\n \napp-id\n\n\nONESIGNAL_API_KEY\n \n=\n \napp-key\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart the server, and add one background worker for the \nwebpush\n queue. This queue will handle the creation of the apps, as well as sending the push notifications.\n\n\nThen you will need to update your PYBOSSA theme to allow your\nusers to subscribe. As this could vary a lot from one project to\nanother, we do not provide a template but some guidelines:\n\n\n\n\nUse the JS SDK to subscribe a user to a given project using the\n  \ntags\n option of Onesignal.\n\n\nPYBOSSA sends notifications using those tags thanks to the   \nfilters\n option that allows us to segment traffic. PYBOSSA is\n  expecting the project.id as the tag key for segmenting.\n\n\nThe JS SDK allows you to subscribe/unsubscribe a user to a given project (not only the whole server) with unique methods for adding tags and deleting them. This works independently if the user is authenticated or not.\n\n\n\n\nFor more info regarding Onesignal JS SDK, check their \ndocumentation.\n\n\nIgnore specific keys when exporting data in CSV format\n\n\nSometimes your PYBOSSA project saves information like GeoJSON within the tasks or task_runs. This is a bad thing for the exporter, as it will try to flatten it. In such scenarios, you want to instruct PYBOSSA to ignore those keys, as they will be included in the JSON export files, and reduce all the overhead (as well as destroying the format due to the normalization).\n\n\nFor ignoring a key (or a list of keys), just add the following config\nvariable to your settings_local.py file:\n\n\n1\nIGNORE_FLAT_KEYS\n \n=\n \n[\n \ngeojson\n,\n \nkey1\n,\n \n...\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecify a new root key instead of info for CSV exporter\n\n\nSometimes you need to change the root key for the CSV exporter. This usually happens, when you have to store one ore more answers within the same info object. For this reason, you can instruct PYBOSSA to use that key instead of \ninfo\n for flattening the data:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\nTASK_CSV_EXPORT_INFO_KEY\n \n=\n \nkey\n\n\nTASK_RUN_CSV_EXPORT_INFO_KEY\n \n=\n \nkey2\n\n\nRESULT_CSV_EXPORT_INFO_KEY\n \n=\n \nkey3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this way, if key, key2 or key3 have an array or list of dictionaries, PYBOSSA will iterate over them, flat them, and then generate the CSV for you.\n\n\nDisable task presenter check for pure JavaScript apps\n\n\nWhen you are using PYBOSSA native JSON support, you will not be building your project presenter within the PYBOSSA structure, but within the JS framework of your choice.\n\n\nIn such a case, you would like to disable the check for the task_presenter when publishing a project. If you need this, just add\nthis flag to your settings_local.py file:\n\n\n1\nDISABLE_TASK_PRESENTER\n \n=\n \nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsent field for users\n\n\nSometimes you will need the users to click on a checkbox before\ncreating an account to get the agreement for sending them email\nnotifications or of any other type. By default, PYBOSSA provides this\nflag, and it\ns set to False.\n\n\nChange in the theme (or your frontend) the label of the field to\nwhatever you prefer: Terms of Service, Communications, etc. so you will be able to keep track of who has accepted/declined to get notifications from you.\n\n\nCustom Leaderboards\n\n\nBy default, PYBOSSA provides a unique leaderboard. This leaderboard is based on the number of task runs that a user has submitted. However, you may want more flexibility. For this reason, you can use use the \nuser\n.info field to store any other \nbadges\n or values that you want to score your users.\n\n\nIf your users have identified very complicated stuff, and you want to\ngive points to them based on that, just use the info field and instruct\nPYBOSSA to create a leaderboard for you.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIt is essential that this key, projectsvalue pair is computed by you. You can use the API to update these values, so this will not be handled by PYBOSSA but by yourself.\n\n\n\n\nImagine the score is named: foo, then, PYBOSSA will create for you a leaderboard using that key like this: edit the settings_local.py file\nand add the following config variable:\n\n\n1\nLEADERBOARDS\n \n=\n \n[\nfoo\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, you can access the specific leaderboard using the endpoint:\n/leaderboard/?info=foo\n\n\nAs simple as that.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis feature relies on background jobs. Be sure that you are running them.\n\n\n\n\nDefault number of users for the leaderboard\n\n\nYou can specify the default number of users shown in the leaderboard. By default we show the top 20 users.\n\n\n1\nLEADERBOARD = 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnpublish inactive projects\n\n\nPYBOSSA by default unpublishes projects that have not been active in the last three months. You can disable this feature by changing this config variable in your settings_local.py file:\n\n\n1\nUNPUBLISH_PROJECTS\n \n=\n \nFalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLDAP integration\n\n\nPYBOSSA can use LDAP for authenticating users. You will need to add a few config variables to the settings_local.py file to\nmake it work.\n\n\nPYBOSSA supports LDAP and OpenLDAP protocols, so you should be able to use any of them.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nBy enabling PYBOSSA LDAP integration, all other means for creating accounts and sign in will be disabled.\n\n\n\n\nLDAP_HOST\n\n\nThis variable should have the IP or domain name of your LDAP server.\n\n\nLDAP_BASE_DN\n\n\nThis is the LDAP Base DN for your organization.\n\n\nLDAP_USERNAME\n\n\nThis variable should have the admin account so that PYBOSSA can access the LDAP server and search for users.\n\n\nLDAP_PASSWORD\n\n\nThe admin account password.\n\n\nLDAP_OBJECTS_DN\n\n\nThe DN.\n\n\nLDAP_OPENLDAP\n\n\nSet it to True if you are using it.\n\n\nLDAP_USER_OBJECT_FILTER\n\n\nThis is important. The filter that you write in here needs to be\nadapted to your institution, otherwise, it will not work when\nauthenticating and validating your users.\n\n\nDon\nt use the default configuration in the settings template. You will\nneed to adapt it to your needs.\n\n\nLDAP_USER_FILTER_FIELD\n\n\nIf you use a different field in the previous configuration, update the\nLDAP_USER_FILTER_FIELD. It\ns important to reflect which key are you using within your LDAP server to identify your users uniquely.\n\n\nLDAP_PYBOSSA_FIELDS\n\n\nUse this configuration variable to match/link PYBOSSA fields to LDAP fields.\n\n\nUploading files to PYBOSSA\n\n\nPYBOSSA has a generic uploader that will check for valid extensions, avoiding for example that a user could upload a video, as only\nimages are allowed.\n\n\nALLOWED_EXTENSIONS\n\n\nUse this configuration variable, to specify which types of files will you allow in your server to be uploaded via the API. By default, the following extensions\nare enabled:\n\n\n1\nALLOWED_EXTENSIONS\n \n=\n \n[\njs\n,\n \ncss\n,\n \npng\n,\n \njpg\n,\n \njpeg\n,\n \ngif\n,\n \nzip\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPAM protection\n\n\nYou can blacklist disposable email accounts by listing them in the SPAM config. Just add them like this:\n\n\n1\nSPAM\n \n=\n \n[\nspam.com\n,\n \nfake.es\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFailed Jobs\n\n\nSometimes background jobs fail. For example, an email is rejected. By default\nPYBOSSA retries 3 times, before marking them as failed. You can customize it.\n\n\n1\nFAILED_JOBS_RETRIES\n \n=\n \n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFulltext search language\n\n\nPYBOSSA uses PostgreSQL fulltex search support. Thus, you can instruct PYBOSSA\nto use only a given language to do it properly:\n\n\n1\nFULLTEXTSEARCH_LANGUAGE\n \n=\n \nenglish\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolute links to Avatars\n\n\nIf you are building a Single Page Application or a Universal App, you will need to\nget absolute paths to the avatars. Use the following config:\n\n\n1\nAVATAR_ABSOLUTE\n \n=\n \nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelete inactive accounts\n\n\nPYBOSSA will delete inactive accounts after a period of time. For this purpose,\nPYBOSSA uses two different background jobs, one for warning users about the\naction, and another one to delete them.\n\n\nThe warning job is run on a monthly basis, while the deletion is done on a\nbi-monthly basis.\n\n\nYou can customize the the time period that you consider to warn users as well as\nto delete them. For these purposes you can use the following two variables:\n\n\n1\n2\nUSER_INACTIVE_NOTIFICATION\n \n=\n \n5\n\n\nUSER_DELETE_AFTER_NOTIFICATION\n \n=\n \n1 month\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThus, after 5 months of not contributing a single task run, the user will get an\nemail warning her about the deletion. Then, the next month if the user has not\nsent a task run, the account will be deleted.\n\n\nFor deleting the accounts, PYBOSSA uses the the same method as if the user\nrequested it herself. The action anonymizes the user\ns contributions, and\ndeletes all her personal data.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nPYBOSSA will not delete users with the restrict flag set to true (to respect\nGDPR) as well as if they have projects.",

We recommend using these translations with the default theme. If you use your theme, the best thing is to do your translation, (see  translating ), as you might want to name things differently on the templates.  You can disable/enable different languages in your config file settings_local.py .

This will work for anonymous users, while registered ones can specify the language they want using their user preferences.

We highly recommend installing PYBOSSA under a regular user (without any privileges) to run the PYBOSSA technology. We will refer to this user as \npybossa\n.\n\n\nInstalling nginx and uwsgi\n\n\nYou have to install nginx and uwsgi on your server machine. In a\nDebian/Ubuntu machine you can install them running the following\ncommands:\n\n\n1\nsudo apt-get install nginx\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the (virtualenv-)installation directory of pybossa, you need to\ninstall uwsgi:\n\n\n1\npip install -U uwsgi\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring nginx and uwsgi for PYBOSSA\n\n\nWe assume you only want to run PYBOSSA on your nginx web server. If you need to run also other services on the same server, you need to modify the nginx config files!\n\n\nYou have to copy and adapt the following files from your local PYBOSSA installation:\n\n\n\n\ncontrib/nginx/pybossa\n\n\ncontrib/pybossa.ini\n\n\n\n\nThe PYBOSSA virtual host file (\ncontrib/nginx/pybossa\n) has the\nfollowing directives:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\nlocation\n \n/\n \n{\n \ntry_files\n \n$uri\n \n@pybossa\n;\n \n}\n\n\n\nlocation\n \n@\npybossa\n \n{\n\n    \ninclude\n \nuwsgi_params\n;\n\n    \nuwsgi_pass\n \nunix\n:/\ntmp\n/\npybossa\n.\nsock\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nlocation\n  \n/\nstatic\n \n{\n\n\n            \n#\n \nchange\n \nthat\n \nto\n \nyour\n \npybossa\n \nstatic\n \ndirectory\n\n            \nalias\n \n/home/Scifabric/pybossa/pybossa/themes/default/static\n;\n\n\n            \nautoindex\n \non\n;\n\n            \nexpires\n \nmax\n;\n\n        \n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can specify a user and group from your machine with lower privileges to improve the security of the site. You can also use the www-data user and group name.\n\n\nOnce you have adapted the PATH in the alias in that file, copy it into\nthe folder:\n\n\n1\nsudo cp contrib/nginx/pybossa /etc/nginx/sites-available/.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease delete the default config in sites-enabled (do not worry there is a backup):\n\n\n1\nsudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable the PYBOSSA site:\n\n\n1\nsudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/pybossa /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/pybossa\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd restart the server:\n\n1\nsudo service nginx restart\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating the pybossa.ini file for uwsgi\n\n\nYou have to copy the \npybossa.ini.template\n file to pybossa.ini in\nyour PYBOSSA installation and adapt the paths to match your\nconfiguration!\n\n\nThe content of this file is the following:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n[\nuwsgi\n]\n\n\nsocket\n \n=\n \n/\ntmp\n/\npybossa\n.\nsock\n\n\nchmod\n-\nsocket\n \n=\n \n666\n\n\nchdir\n \n=\n \n/\nhome\n/\npybossa\n/\npybossa\n\n\npythonpath\n \n=\n \n..\n\n\nvirtualenv\n \n=\n \n/\nhome\n/\npybossa\n/\npybossa\n/\nenv\n\n\nmodule\n \n=\n \nrun\n:\napp\n\n\ncpu\n-\naffinity\n \n=\n \n1\n\n\nprocesses\n \n=\n \n2\n\n\nthreads\n \n=\n \n2\n\n\nstats\n \n=\n \n/\ntmp\n/\npybossa\n-\nstats\n.\nsock\n\n\nbuffer\n-\nsize\n \n=\n \n65535\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall supervisord\n\n\nSupervisord\n is used to let PYBOSSA and its RQ system run as Daemon in the background. It shares some of the same goals of programs like launchd, daemontools, and runit.\n\n\nInstall it:\n\n\n1\nsudo apt-get install supervisor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigure Redis and sentinel as a service with supervisord\n\n\nFirst stop Redis service and all running Redis instances with:\n\n\n1\n2\nsudo service redis-server stop\nkillall redis-server\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe want to run redis and sentinel with supervisord because supervisord is more reliable when redis crashes (which can happen when you do not have enough RAM). So we disable redis-server daemon service with:\n\n\n1\nsudo rm /etc/init.d/redis-server\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to your pybossa installation directory and copy following files:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nsudo cp contrib/supervisor/redis-server.conf /etc/supervisor/conf.d/\nsudo cp contrib/supervisor/redis-sentinel.conf /etc/supervisor/conf.d/\nsudo cp contrib/redis-supervisor/redis.conf /etc/redis/\nsudo cp contrib/redis-supervisor/sentinel.conf /etc/redis/\nsudo chown redis:redis /etc/redis/redis.conf\nsudo chown redis:redis /etc/redis/sentinel.conf\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we restart supervisord (please do a full stop and start as\ndescribed):\n\n\n1\n2\nsudo service supervisor stop\nsudo service supervisor start\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo verify the installation,  you can list all redis processes, and you should see a \nredis-server\n at port 6379 and \nredis-sentinel\n at port 26379:\n\n\n1\nps aux \n|\n grep redis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese two services will now run whenever the server is running (even after reboot).\n\n\nConfigure RQ-Scheduler and RQ-Worker to run with supervisord\n\n\nYou need to adjust the paths and user account in this two config files according to your installation. Then copy them to supervisor (do not\nforget to edit them):\n\n\n1\n2\nsudo cp contrib/supervisor/rq-scheduler.conf.template /etc/supervisor/conf.d/rq-scheduler.conf\nsudo cp contrib/supervisor/rq-worker.conf.template /etc/supervisor/conf.d/rq-worker.conf\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart supervisor:\n\n\n1\n2\nsudo service supervisor stop\nsudo service supervisor start\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify that the service is running. You should see a rqworker and rqscheduler instance in the console:\n\n\n1\nps aux \n|\n grep rq\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup PYBOSSA itself\n\n\nAs we are going to run PYBOSSA via nginx, we have to remove from the settings file the HOST and PORT sections. You can also comment them:\n\n\n1\n2\n# HOST = \n0.0.0.0\n\n\n# PORT = 12000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter modifying the settings file, add the full server URL where your PYBOSSA is reachable:\n\n\n1\n2\nSERVER_NAME\n \n=\n \nmypybossa\n.\ncom\n\n\nPORT\n \n=\n \n80\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet PYBOSSA run as service\n\n\nFinally, we need to let pybossa run as service. Adjust the paths and username again in this file and copy it to the supervisor config directory:\n\n\n1\nsudo cp contrib/supervisor/pybossa.conf.template /etc/supervisor/conf.d/pybossa.conf\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit now the file and adjust the paths \n username.\n\n\nRestart supervisor:\n\n\n1\n2\nsudo service supervisor stop\nsudo service supervisor start\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should have now a running PYBOSSA production web server on your nginx installation. Open your browser and check your configured domain: \nhttp://example.com\n.\n\n\nCongratulations! \n\n\nHow to update the PYBOSSA service\n\n\nUpgrading and updating PYBOSSA as service works the same as for the standalone version. Please follow instructions on the \ninstallation instructions\n. Once you have upgraded the code, you will need to restart all supervisor controlled services to get the changes:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\nsudo supervisorctl restart rq-scheduler\nsudo supervisorctl restart rq-worker\nsudo supervisorctl restart pybossa\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogs of PYBOSSA services\n\n\nYou can find logs of all PYBOSSA services in this directory:\n\n\n1\ncd\n /var/log/supervisor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast words about Security and Scaling\n\n\nThis guide does not cover how to secure your PYBOSSA installation. As every web server, you have to make it secure (like, e.g., strong passwords, automatic Ubuntu security updates, firewall, access restrictions). Please use guides on the Internet to do so.\n\n\nPYBOSSA can also be scaled horizontally to run with redundant servers and with zero downtime over many redis, DB and web servers with load balancers in between.\n\n\nIf you need a secure and scalable PYBOSSA installation, please contact us. We offer hosted PYBOSSA servers, and we will handle all the hosting, customization, administration and setup for you. Check our  \npricing page\n and get in touch.",

For solving this issue\njust, modify the VirtualBox path to point to a partition or disk that has enough space. You can then manually change it with\nthis command: VBoxManage setproperty machinefolder to/new/path",

You may wish to start with the \nstep by step tutorial\n; which walks through creating a simple photo classification project if you want to understand all the details about how a project works.\n\n\nFirst of all, we have to create a project for the project. To create a project, you will have to provide the following information:\n\n\n\n\nName\n,\n\n\nShort name\n or \nslug\n, and\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nThe \nslug\n or \nshort name\n is a shortcut for accessing the project\nvia the web (short URLs like this \nhttp://domain.com/project/slug\n).\n\n\nThe \ndescription\n is a short sentence that will be used to describe\nyour project (think about it as a Tweet long description).\n\n\nA project can be created using two different methods:\n\n\n\n\nweb interface, or\n\n\nAPI interface.\n\n\n\n\nUsing the Web Interface\n\n\nCreating a project using the web interface involves four steps:\n\n\n\n\nBuilding the project,\n\n\nImport the tasks using one of the available \ntask importers\n,\n\n\nWrite the task-presenter for the users, and\n\n\nPublish the project.\n\n\n\n\nCreating the project\n\n\nTo create a project using the web interface you have\nto:\n\n\nCreate a PYBOSSA account\n\n\nYou can create an account filling a form.\n\n\n\n\nIf PYBOSSA has Twiter, Facebook or Google authentication methods enabled, you will be able to create an account using them. See the \ndocumentation\n for more information about these alternatives.\n\n\n\n\nYou can also set preferences for language, location, area of expertise(termed as user type) and set metadata for the account. For this, pybossa server need to be configured with new settings; sample for same can be obtained from pybossa/settings_upref_mdata.py.tmpl. Rename settings_upref_mdata.py.tmpl to settings_upref_mdata.py and copy it under folder containing settings_local.py. With this, contents of settings_upref_mdata.py will be available on account filling form.\n\n\n\n\nUser preference/metedata set for the account can viewed and modified under account profile page.\n\n\n\n\nCreating the project\n\n\nOnce you have an account, click in \ncreate the ** link of the navigation bar. After clicking on the previous link, you will have to fill in a    form with the fundamental information to create your project:\n    1.  **Name\n: the full name of your project, i.e., \nFlickr Person\n        Finder\n.\n    2.  \nShort Name\n: the \nslug\n or short name used in the URL for         accessing your project, i.e., \nflickrperson\n.\n    3.  \nLong Description\n: A \nlong\n description where you can use\n        Markdown to format the description of your project. This field\n        is usually used to provide information about the project, the\n        developer, the researcher group or institutions involved in the\n        project, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nPYBOSSA usually provides two Project Categories by default: \nthinking\n and \nsensing\n. The \nthinking\n category represents the standard PYBOSSA project where users contribute helping with their skills. \nSensing\n category refers to projects that are using volunteer sensing tools like EpiCollect or Raspberry Pi with PYBOSSA for gathering data.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have filled all the fields, click in the \nCreate the project\n button, and you will have created your first project \n\n\nAfter creating the project, you should be redirected to the \nSettings\n  project page, where you will be able to customize your project by adding some extra information or changing some settings. There, you will find a form with the same fields as in the previous step (just in case you\nve changed your mind and wanted to change any of them) plus the following:\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n: A \nshort\n description of the project, e.g., \nA    project to classify cancer cells\n. By default, this field is automatically populated with the information that you provided in the \nLong description\n field.\n\n\nAllow Anonymous Contributors\n: By default, anonymous and authenticated users can participate in all the projects. However, you can change it only to allow authenticated volunteers to participate.\n\n\nPassword\n: If you want to control who can access your project, you can set a password here to share with those you allow to do it. If you leave it blank, then no password will protect your project.\n\n\nCategory\n: Select a category that fits your project. Categories\n   are added and managed by the server administrators.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nAlso, you will be able to select and upload a \nimage\n from your local computer to set it as the project image throughout the server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImporting the tasks via the built-in CSV Task Importer\n\n\nTasks can be imported from different services like Dropbox or Amazon S3 via the importers. To use one, just do the following:\n1. Navigate to your project\ns page (you can directly access it using\n   the \nslug\n project name: \nhttp://server/project/slug\n).\n2. Click in the \nTasks\n section -on the left side local navigation\n   menu:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd click again on the \nImport Tasks\n card. After clicking on it, you will see several options. The first ones are for using the different kinds of importers supported by PYBOSSA: Amazon S3, Twitter, Dropbox, Flickr, Youtube, Google Spreadsheet, CSV URL, IIIF, and EpiCollect Plus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, the Flickr importer will allow importing a Flickr album by typing its ID or if you have an account, by logging into Flickr and\nshowing your public (and creative commons licensed) albums:\n\n\n\n\nSelect one of the albums, click import and all the pictures will be\nimported as tasks for your PYBOSSA project. As simple as that \n.\n\n\nThe other importers are very similar. In most cases, you\nll provide a URL to the resource, like for the CSV and Google Spreadsheet importer, while the Dropbox, Amazon S3, Twitter, Youtube, and EpiCollect Plus importers will have a friendly interface to import data automagically for you.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you\nre trying to import from a Google Spreadsheet, ensure the file is accessible to everyone via the Share option, choosing: \nPublic on the web - Anyone on the Internet can find and view.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYour spreadsheet/CSV file must contain a header row. All the fields in the CSV will be serialized to JSON and stored in the \ninfo\n field. If your field name is one of \nstate\n, \nquorum\n, \ncalibration\n,    \npriority_0\n, or \nn_answers\n, it will be saved in the respective     columns. Your spreadsheet must be visible to the public or everyone with an URL.\n\n\n\n\nIn the Task Importer section, you\nll also find other pre-loaded Google Spreadsheets URLs. Those templates are examples that you can use\nto learn how to create your spreadsheets and import data for image,\nsound, video, pdf mining and mapping projects.\n\n\n\n\nBy using these templates, you\nll be able to learn the structure of the\ntasks, and directly re-use the task-presenter templates that know the\nstructure (name of the columns) for presenting the task.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can re-use the templates by downloading the CSV files from Google Docs, or even copying them to your own Google Drive account (click in \nFile\n \n \nMake a copy\n in the Google Doc Spreadsheet). Scifabric provides the following templates:\n\n\n\n\nImage Pattern Recognition\n\n\nSound Pattern Recognition\n\n\nVideo Pattern Recognition\n\n\nGeo-coding\n\n  and\n\n\nPDF transcription\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nIf you import the same URL again, only new records will be added to the project.\n\n\n\n\nImporting the tasks from an EpiCollect Plus Public Project\n\n\nEpiCollect\n provides a web tool for the\ngeneration of forms for many kinds of mobile data collection projects.\n\n\nData can be collected using multiple mobile phones running either the Android Operating system or the iPhone (using the EpiCollect mobile app), and all data can be synchronized from the phones and viewed centrally (using Google Maps) via the Project website or directly on the phones.\n\n\nEpiCollect can help you to recollect data samples according to a form that could include multimedia like photos. Moreover, EpiCollect can geolocate the data sample as it supports the built-in GPS that all modern smartphones have.\n\n\nFor example, you can create an EpiCollect project where the form will ask the user to take a picture of a lake, geo-locate it automatically via the built-in smartphone GPS and upload the image to the EpiCollect server. If the user does not have Internet access at that moment, the user will be able to synchronize the data afterward, i.e., when the user has access to an Internet WIFI hotspot.\n\n\nPYBOSSA can automatically import data from a public EpiCollect Plus project that you own or that it is publicly available on the\nwebsite. Then you will be able to validate, analyze, etc. the data that has been obtained via EpiCollect.\n\n\nIf you want to import the data points submitted to a \npublic\n\nEpiCollect project, you will have to follow the next steps:\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to your project\ns page (you can directly access it using\n   the \nslug\n project name: \nhttp://server/project/slug\n).\n\n\nClick in the \nTasks\n section -on the left side local navigation\n   menu.\n\n\nAnd click on the \nImport Tasks\n button. After clicking on it you\n   will see several different options.\n\n\nClick on the \nUse an EpiCollect Project\n one.\n    \n\n\nThen, type the \nname of the EpiCollect project\n and the name of the \nform\n that you want to import and click on the import button.\n\n\n\n\nAll the data points should be imported now in your project.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nEpiCollect projects will be gathering data mostly all the time, for this reason, if you import again the same EpiCollect project, only  \nnew data points\n will be imported. This feature will allow you to easily add new data points to the PYBOSSA project without having to do anything special.\n\n\n\n\nImporting the tasks from a Flickr photo set\n\n\nPYBOSSA also allows importing tasks for projects based on images (like image pattern recognition ones) directly from a \nFlickr\n [set]\nhttps://www.flickr.com/help/photos/#150321191\n) (also called\nalbum).\n\n\nWhen importing tasks from a Flickr set, a new task will be created for each of the photos in the specified set. The tasks will include the\nfollowing data about each picture (which will be later available to be\nused in the task presenter):\n\n\n\n\ntitle: the title of the photograph, as it appears on Flickr.\n\n\nURL: the URL to the raw .jpg image, in its original size.\n\n\nurl_b: the URL to the image, \nbig sized.\n\n\nurl_m: the URL to the image, \nmedium\n sized.\n\n\nlink: a link to the photo page on Flickr (not to the raw image).\n\n\n\n\nYou can import tasks from a Flickr photo set (a.k.a. album) in either of the following ways: using your Flickr account, or by typing the album ID.\n\n\nThe easiest one is to give the PYBOSSA server permission to access your Flickr list of albums. To do so, you\nll have to log in to your Flickr\naccount by clicking the \nLog in Flickr\n button. Then you\nll be\nredirected to Flickr, where you will be asked if you want to allow\nPYBOSSA to access your Flickr information. If you say yes, then you\nll be again redirected to PYBOSSA, and you\nll see all of your albums. Choose one of them and then click the \nImport\n button to get all the photos created as tasks for your project.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nNext time you try to import photos using the Flickr importer, you\nll see the albums for your account again. If you don\nt want PYBOSSA to access them anymore, or just want to use another Flickr account, then click \nRevoke access.\n\n\n\n\nAnother option to import from a Flickr album is by specifying the ID of the set (collection) directly. This option is a bit more advanced, but  it allows you to import from a photo set that you don\nt own (although, it will have to be public. Also check the rights of the photos on it!). Another advantage is that you don\nt need to log in to Flickr, so you don\nt even need to have a Flickr account.\n\n\nThese are the steps:\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to your project\ns page and click in the \nTasks\n section.\n\n\nThen click on the \nImport Tasks\n button, and select the \nFlickr\n   importer\n.\n\n\nType the ID of the Flickr set you want to import the photos from, then click on the import button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you cannot find the ID or don\nt know which one it is, just browse to the Flickr photo set and check the URL. Can you see that last long number right at the end of it? That\ns what you\nre looking for!\n\n\n\n\nJust like with the other importers, each task will be created only once, even if you import twice from the same Flickr set (unless you add new photos to it, of course!).\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou will need to make sure that every photo belonging to the set has the visibility set to public, so the PYBOSSA server can then access and present them to the volunteers of your project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nFor enabling the Flickr importer, check this \nsection\n.\n\n\n\n\nImporting the tasks from a Dropbox account\n\n\nYou can import tasks from arbitrary data hosted on a Dropbox account with the Dropbox importer. When you import tasks in this way, the following information will be added to the info field of each task, available later to be used in the task presenter of the project:\n\n\n\n\nfilename: just it, the name of the file you\nre importing as a task.\n\n\nlink: the link to the Dropbox page showing the file.\n\n\nlink_raw: the link to the raw file served by Dropbox. This is the\n  one you\nll have to use if you want to direct link to the file from\n  the presenter (e.g., for using an image in a \n tag, you\nd\n  do: \n).\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to this generic information, the Dropbox importer will also recognize some files by their extension and will attach some extra information to them.\n\n\nFor pdf files (.pdf extension), the following fields will be obtained\ntoo:\n\n\n\n\npdf_url: direct link to the raw pdf file, with CORS support.\n\n\n\n\nFor image files (.png, jpg, .jpeg and .gif extensions) the following\ndata will be available:\n\n\n\n\nurl_m: the same as link_raw\n\n\nurl_b: the same as link_raw\n\n\ntitle: the same as the filename\n\n\n\n\nFor audio files (.mp4, .m4a, .mp3, .ogg, .oga, .webm and .wav\nextensions):\n\n\n\n\naudio_url: raw link to the audio file, which can be used inside an\n  HTML 5 \naudio\n tag and supports CORS.\n\n\n\n\nFor video files (.mp4, .m4v, .ogg, .ogv, .webm and .avi extensions):\n\n\n\n\naudio_url: raw link to the video file, which can be used inside an\n  HTML 5 \nvideo\n tag and supports CORS.\n\n\n\n\nThe tasks created with the Dropbox importer are ready to be used with the template project presenters available in PYBOSSA, as they include the described fields.\n\n\nThus, importing your images from Dropbox will allow you to use the image pattern recognition template with them immediately. If you import videos, audio files or PDFs  you will also be able to use the presenter templates for video pattern recognition, sound pattern recognition or documents transcription, respectively, with no additional modifications and have them working right away (as long as the files have any of the mentioned file extensions, of course).\n\n\nFor using this importer, just follow these are the steps:\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to your project\ns page and click in the \nTasks\n section.\n\n\nThen click on the \nImport Tasks\n button, and select the \nDropbox importer\n.\n\n\nClick on the \nChoose from Dropbox\n icon. You will be asked your    Dropbox account credentials. Then select as many files as you want:\n    \n\n\nYou can repeat step 3 as many times as you want, and more files will be added to your import. Then, click on \nImport.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nFor enabling the Dropbox importer, check this \nsection\n.\n\n\n\n\nImporting the tasks from a Twitter account or search result\n\n\nAnother option for importing tasks is using the built-in Twitter\nimporter. It allows importing tweets as tasks from either a specified\nTwitter user account, or from the results returned from a search to the Twitter search API.\n\n\nTasks imported with it will have the tweet data attached to their info field, and can later be used from within the task presenter. This data\nis a direct transcription of the data returned by the Twitter API, in\nparticular a \nTweet\n\nobject.\n\n\nPlease notice that the values returned by the Twitter API may vary.\nHowever, the following fields are guaranteed to be always included in the info field of the tasks:\n\n\n\n\ncreated_at: the date and time the tweet was published.\n\n\nfavorite_count: number of times the tweet has been marked as\n  \nfavorite.\n\n\nretweet_count: number of times the tweet has been retweeted.\n\n\ncoordinates: geographic coordinates of the place the tweet was published.\n  from. Note that this is not always available for every tweet.\n\n\ntweet_id: the internal ID handled by Twitter to identify this\n  tweet.\n\n\nuser: an \nobject\n with\n  information about the tweet author, as returned by the Twitter API.\n\n\ntext: the actual content of the tweet.\n\n\n\n\nAlso, an extra field \nuser_screen_name\n has been added to the\ninfo field:\n\n\n\n\nuser_screen_name: the screen name (or \nhandle\n) of the author of\n  the tweet.\n\n\n\n\nFor more information, please refer to the \nTwitter\n documentation.\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nWhen importing tweets from a search, retweets will be ignored!\n\n\n\n\nSo, to import tasks with the Twitter importer, do as follows:\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to your project\ns page and click in the \nTasks\n section.\n\n\nThen click on the \nImport Tasks\n button, and select the \nTwitter importer\n:\n\n\nYou can provide your own Twitter credentials and make API requests on behalf of them, or use the credentials provided by us. (The later only allows to import the number of tweets returned by a single Twitter API call, which is 100 for searches and 200 for user\n   timelines.)\n\n\nFill in the two fields you will find in the form. The first one is the source of your tweets. If you want them to be imported from a user account, then write it with the \n@\n symbol, like \n@PYBOSSA.\n If you just want to import tweets containing a word on them (or a #hashtag), then type it there. The second field is for you to specify how many tweets you want to import. You can import as many as you want!\n\n\n\n\nFinally, click on the \nImport\n button, and you are done:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nFor enabling the Twitter importer, check this \nsection\n.\n\n\n\n\nImporting tasks from an Amazon S3 bucket\n\n\nTasks can be imported from data hosted on the Amazon S3 service.\nSimilarly to the Dropbox importer, these tasks can use different kind of data, like images, videos, audios, PDF files, etc. hosted on any S3\nbucket.\n\n\nThe S3 importer will work pretty much the same as the Dropbox one. When using it, the created tasks will contain the following data in the info field:\n\n\n\n\nfilename: just it, the name of the file you\nre importing as a task.\n\n\nlink: the link to the raw file served from Amazon S3.\n\n\nURL: same as the above.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to this generic information, the S3 importer will also\nrecognize some files by their extension and will attach some extra information to them.\n\n\nFor pdf files (.pdf extension), the following field will be obtained\ntoo:\n\n\n\n\npdf_url: direct link to the raw pdf file.\n\n\n\n\nFor image files (.png, jpg, .jpeg and .gif extensions) the following\ndata will be available:\n\n\n\n\nurl_m: the same as the link.\n\n\nurl_b: the same as the link.\n\n\ntitle: the same as the filename.\n\n\n\n\nFor audio files (.mp4, .m4a, .mp3, .ogg, .oga, .webm and .wav\nextensions):\n\n\n\n\naudio_url: raw link to the audio file, which can be used inside an\n  HTML 5 \n tag.\n\n\n\n\nFor video files (.mp4, .m4v, .ogg, .ogv, .webm and .avi extensions):\n\n\n\n\naudio_url: raw link to the video file, which can be used inside an\n  HTML 5 \n tag.\n\n\n\n\nThe tasks created with the S3 importer are ready to be used with the\ntemplate project presenters available in PYBOSSA, as they include the described fields.\n\n\nThus, importing your images from S3 will allow you to use the image pattern recognition template with them immediately. If you import videos, audio files or PDFs  you will also be able to use the presenter templates for video pattern recognition, sound pattern recognition or documents transcription, respectively, with no additional modifications and have them working right away (as long as the files have any of the mentioned file extensions, of course).\n\n\nImporting from an S3 bucket requires that the bucket visibility is set to \npublic\n so its content can be seen and listed by PYBOSSA. To make a bucket public, go to your AWS management console and select the S3 service. Then select the bucket you want to make public and click on \nProperties.\n Click on \nAdd more Permissions\n and add a new one with \nGrantee: Everyone\n and the \nList\n checkbox selected, like in the following image:\n\n\n\n\nYou may also need to enable CORS in the bucket. In the same menu as above, click on \nEdit CORS Configuration\n and configure it. You can\nlearn more \nhere\n.\n\n\nFinally, you need to make sure that every file inside the bucket that\nyou want to use in a task has a \npublic\n link too. Go to the bucket\ncontent and select the files. Then click on \nActions\n and select \nMake\nPublic\n. Your files will now be visible for everyone, including a\nPYBOSSA server.\n\n\n\n\nOnce your S3 bucket is ready, you can follow these steps to import tasks from it:\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to your project\ns page and click in the \nTasks\n section.\n\n\nThen click on the \nImport Tasks\n button, and select the \nS3\n   importer\n.\n\n\n\n\nType the name of the bucket from which you will be importing your tasks and click on \nSearch in the bucket.\n If you followed the steps above and your bucket is public, you will see a list of the items it contains. Select as many as you want:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you\nre ready, click on \nImport.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImporting the tasks from Youtube\n\n\nTasks can be imported from Youtube. Currently, the importer supports importing from Youtube with:\n\n\n\n\nPlaylists\n\n\n\n\nWhen importing the video, the importer parses all videos information and creates tasks with info fields:\n\n\n\n\nvideo_url: the URL of the youtube video which can be embedded in\n  the task form.\n\n\noembed: embeddable code for the (old) PYBOSSA video templates.\n\n\n\n\nThe tasks created with the Youtube importer are ready to be used with the youtube and video templates.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nFor enabling the Youtube importer, check this \nsection\n.\n\n\n\n\nImporting the tasks from a IIIF manifest\n\n\nThe \nInternational Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF)\n is a protocol for standardized image retrieval created by a community of the world\ns leading research libraries, major national libraries and not-for-profit image repositories in an effort to collaboratively produce an interoperable technology and community framework for image delivery.\n\n\nContent made available via the \nIIIF Presentation API\n can be imported into PyBossa by passing the URI of a manifest. All images for all canvases defined in the first sequence of the manifest will be imported. In practice, this means that all images will be imported in their default order and each image used to generate a single task.\n\n\nEach task will include a reference to the canvas ID, the manifest ID, the tile source for the image and URIs to request different sizes of the image from the \nIIIF Image API\n.\n\n\nHere are the steps to import:\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to your project\ns page and click in the \nTasks\n section.\n\n\nThen click on the \nImport Tasks\n button, and select the \nIIIF importer\n.\n\n\nType the URI of the IIIF manifest that you want to import from, then click on the import button.\n\n\n\n\nFlushing all the tasks\n\n\nThe project settings gives you an option to automatically \ndelete all\nthe tasks and associated task volunteer\n from your project.\n\n\n\n\nDanger\n\n\nThis action cannot be undone, so please, be sure that you want to actually, delete all the tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nThis action will only allow you to delete tasks that are not associated with a result. When a result is created, that task and its task runs cannot be deleted so the volunteers can always have access to their contributions.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are sure that you want to flush all the tasks and task runs for\nyour project, go to the project page (http://server/project/slug/tasks/) and click on the \nSettings\n option of the left local navigation menu:\n\n\n\n\nThen, you will see that there is a subsection called: \nTask Settings\n and a button with the label: \nDelete the tasks\n. Click on that button and a new page will be shown:\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, a \nred warning alert\n is shown, warning you that if\nyou click on the \nyes\n button, you will be deleting not only the\nproject tasks but also the answers (task runs) that you have\nrecollected for your project. Be sure before proceeding that you want to delete all the tasks. After clicking on the \nyes\n button, you will see that all the tasks have been flushed.\n\n\nCreating the Task Presenter\n\n\nOnce you have the project and you have imported some tasks, you can start working with the task-presenter, which will be the web project that will get the tasks of your project, present them to the volunteer and save the answers provided by the users.\n\n\nIf you have followed all the steps described in this section, you will\nbe already on the page of your project, however, if you are not, you only need to access your project URL to work with your project. If  your project \nslug\n or \nshort name\n is \nflickrperson\n you will be able to access the project managing options in this URL:\n\n\n1\nhttp://PYBOSSA-SERVER/project/flickrperson\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou need to be logged in. Otherwise, you will not be able to modify the project.\n\n\n\n\nAnother way of accessing your project (or projects) is clicking on your \nusername\n (at the navbar) and select the \nMy Projects\n item from the but it menu. From there you will be able to manage your projects:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have chosen your project, you can add a task-presenter by\nclicking on the \nTasks\n local navigation link, and then clicking on the button named \nEditor\n under the \nTask Presenter\n box.\n\n\n\n\nAfter clicking this button, a new web page will be shown where you\ncan choose a template to start coding your project, so you don\nt have to start from scratch.\n\n\n\n\nAfter choosing one of the templates, you will be able to adapt it to fit\nyour project needs in a web text editor.\n\n\n\n\nClick on the \nPreview button\n to get an idea of how it will look\nlike your task-presenter.\n\n\n\n\nWe recommend reading the \nStep by step tutorial\n as you will understand how to create the task presenter, which explains how you can add some HTML skeleton to load the task data, input fields to get the answer from the users, and some JavaScript to make it work.\n\n\nPublishing the project\n\n\nAfter completing the previous three steps, your project will be almost ready. The final step is to publish it, because now it will still be a draft, and it will be hidden to everyone but you (and admins).\n\n\nWhen your project is a draft, you can contribute to it, and the answers (task runs) and results will be stored in the database so you can have access to them (and test the webhooks solution if you want to do real-time analysis). However, in the moment of publishing the project all the task runs and results (as well as the webhooks log entries) will be flushed, so don\nt be afraid and try it as much as you can until you are sure that everything works as expected.

To do it so, just protect it with a password, and people will be able to access it (as long as they have the password, of course).\n\n\n\n\nAfter publishing it, you will be able to access your project using the\nslug, or under your account in the \nPublished\n projects section.\n\n\nAlso, results will begin to be created every time a task is completed.\nEnjoy!\n\n\nUsing the API\n\n\nCreating a project using the API involves these steps:\n\n\n\n\nCreate the project,\n\n\nCreate the tasks for the project, and\n\n\nCreate the task-presenter for the users.\n\n\nPublish it. This needs to be done via the web interface.\n\n\n\n\nCreating the project\n\n\nYou can create a project via the API URL \n/api/project\n with a POST request (See \napi\n).\n\n\nYou have to provide the following information about the project and\nconvert it to a JSON object (the actual values are taken from the\n\nFlickr Person demo project\n):\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nname\n \n=\n \nu\nFlickr\n \nPerson\n \nFinder\n\n\nshort_name\n \n=\n \nu\nFlickrPerson\n\n\ndescription\n \n=\n \nu\nDo\n \nyou\n \nsee\n \na\n \nhuman\n \nin\n \nthis\n \nphoto?\n\n\ninfo\n \n=\n \n{\n \ntask_presenter\n:\n \nu\ndiv\n \nSkeleton\n \nfor\n \nthe\n \ntasks\n/div\n \n}\n\n\ndata\n \n=\n \ndict(name\n \n=\n \nname,\n \nshort_name\n \n=\n \nshort_name,\n \ndescription\n \n=\n \ndescription,\n \ninfo\n \n=\n \ninfo,\n \nhidden\n \n=\n \n0\n)\n\n\ndata\n \n=\n \njson.dumps(data)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlickr Person Finder, which is a \ndemo template\n that \nyou can\nre-use\n to create your own project, simplifies this step by using a\nsimple file named \nproject.json\n:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n{\n\n\nname\n:\n \nFlickr Person Finder\n,\n\n\nshort_name\n:\n \nflickrperson\n,\n\n\ndescription\n:\n \nImage pattern recognition\n,\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe file provides the basic configuration for your project.\n\n\nAdding tasks\n\n\nAs in all the previous steps, we are going to create a JSON object and\nPOST it using the following API URL \n/api/task\n to add tasks\nto a project that you own.\n\n\nFor PYBOSSA all the tasks are JSON objects with a field named \ninfo\n where the owners of the project can add any JSON object that will represent a task for their project. For example, using again the \nFlickr Person demo project\n template, we need to create a JSON object that should have the link to the photo that we want to identify:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\ninfo\n \n=\n \ndict\n \n(\nlink\n=\nphoto\n[\nlink\n],\n\n             \nurl\n=\nphoto\n[\nurl_m\n],\n\n             \nquestion\n=\nDo you see a human face in this photo?\n)\n\n\ndata\n \n=\n \ndict\n \n(\nproject_id\n=\nproject_id\n,\n\n             \nstate\n=\n0\n,\n\n             \ninfo\n=\ninfo\n,\n\n             \ncalibration\n=\n0\n,\n\n             \npriority_0\n=\n0\n)\n\n\ndata\n \n=\n \njson\n.\ndumps\n(\ndata\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nurl_m\n is a pattern to describe the URL to the \nm\n medium size of the photo used by Flickr. It can be whatever you want, but as we are using Flickr, we use the same patterns for storing the data.\n\n\n\n\nThe most important field for the task is the \ninfo\n one. This field\nwill be used to store a JSON object with the required data for the task. As \nFlickr Person\n is trying to figure out if there is a human or not in a photo, the provided information is:\n\n\n\n\nthe Flickr web page posting the photo, and\n\n\nthe direct URL to the image, the \n value.\n\n\n\n\nThe \ninfo\n field is a free-form field that can be populated with any\nstructure. If your project needs more fields, you can add them and use the format that best fits your needs.\n\n\nThese steps are usually coded in a script. The Flickr Person\nFinder projects provides a template for the task-creator that can be\nre-used without any problems (check the createTasks.py script).\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe API request has to be authenticated and authorized\n. You can get an API-KEY creating an account on the server, and check the API-KEY created for your user, check the profile account (click on your username) and copy the field \nAPI-KEY\n.\n\n\nThis API-KEY should be passed as a POST argument like this with the previous data:\n\n\n[POST] \nhttp://domain/api/task/?api_key=API-KEY\n\n\n\n\nOne of the benefits of using the API is that you can create tasks\npolling other web services like Flickr, where you can use an\nAPI. Once we have created the tasks, we will need to create the\ntask-presenter for the project.\n\n\nCreating the Task Presenter\n\n\nThe task-presenter is usually a template of HTML and JavaScript that will present the tasks to the users, and save the answers in the\ndatabase. The \nFlickr Person demo project\n provides a template which has a \n to load the input files, in this case, the photo, and another \n to load the action buttons that the users will be able to press to answer the question and save it in the database. Please, check the \ntutorial\n for more details about the task-presenter.\n\n\nAs we will be using the API for creating the task presenter, we will have to create an HTML file in our computer, read it from a\na script, and post it into PYBOSSA using the API.\n\n\nOnce the presenter has been posted to the project, you can edit it\nlocally with your editor, or using the PYBOSSA interface (see\nprevious section).\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe API request has to be authenticated and authorized\n. You can get an API-KEY creating an account on the server, and check the API-KEY created for your user, check the profile account (click on your user name) and copy the field \nAPI-KEY\n.\n\n\nThis API-KEY should be passed as a POST argument like this with the previous data: [POST] \nhttp://domain/api/project/?api_key=API-KEY\n\n\n\n\nUsing PYBOSSA API from the command line\n\n\nWhile you can use your preferred programming language to access the API, we recommend you to use the \nPYBOSSA PBS command line\ntool\n as it simplifies the usage of\nPYBOSSA for any given project.\n\n\nCreating a project is as simple as creating a project.json file and then\nrun the following command:\n\n\n1\npbs --server server --api-key yourkey create_project\n\n\n\n\nPlease, read the \npbs section\n for more details.",

You can import tasks from a Flickr photo set (a.k.a. album) in either of the following ways: using your Flickr account, or by typing the album ID.  The easiest one is to give the PYBOSSA server permission to access your Flickr list of albums. To do so, you ll have to log in to your Flickr\naccount by clicking the  Log in Flickr  button.

Note  Next time you try to import photos using the Flickr importer, you ll see the albums for your account again. If you don t want PYBOSSA to access them anymore, or just want to use another Flickr account, then click  Revoke access.   Another option to import from a Flickr album is by specifying the ID of the set (collection) directly. This option is a bit more advanced, but  it allows you to import from a photo set that you don t own (although, it will have to be public. Also check the rights of the photos on it!). Another advantage is that you don t need to log in to Flickr, so you don t even need to have a Flickr account.

Importing from an S3 bucket requires that the bucket visibility is set to  public  so its content can be seen and listed by PYBOSSA. To make a bucket public, go to your AWS management console and select the S3 service. Then select the bucket you want to make public and click on  Properties.  Click on  Add more Permissions  and add a new one with  Grantee: Everyone  and the  List  checkbox selected, like in the following image:   You may also need to enable CORS in the bucket. In the same menu as above, click on  Edit CORS Configuration  and configure it. You can\nlearn more  here .  Finally, you need to make sure that every file inside the bucket that\nyou want to use in a task has a  public  link too. Go to the bucket\ncontent and select the files. Then click on  Actions  and select  Make\nPublic . Your files will now be visible for everyone, including a\nPYBOSSA server.   Once your S3 bucket is ready, you can follow these steps to import tasks from it:   Navigate to your project s page and click in the  Tasks  section.  Then click on the  Import Tasks  button, and select the  S3\n   importer .   Type the name of the bucket from which you will be importing your tasks and click on  Search in the bucket.  If you followed the steps above and your bucket is public, you will see a list of the items it contains. Select as many as you want:     When you re ready, click on  Import.",

For PYBOSSA all the tasks are JSON objects with a field named  info  where the owners of the project can add any JSON object that will represent a task for their project. For example, using again the  Flickr Person demo project  template, we need to create a JSON object that should have the link to the photo that we want to identify:  1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9 info   =   dict   ( link = photo [ link ], \n              url = photo [ url_m ], \n              question = Do you see a human face in this photo? )  data   =   dict   ( project_id = project_id , \n              state = 0 , \n              info = info , \n              calibration = 0 , \n              priority_0 = 0 )  data   =   json . dumps ( data )     Note  url_m  is a pattern to describe the URL to the  m  medium size of the photo used by Flickr. It can be whatever you want, but as we are using Flickr, we use the same patterns for storing the data.   The most important field for the task is the  info  one. This field\nwill be used to store a JSON object with the required data for the task. As  Flickr Person  is trying to figure out if there is a human or not in a photo, the provided information is:   the Flickr web page posting the photo, and  the direct URL to the image, the   value.   The  info  field is a free-form field that can be populated with any\nstructure. If your project needs more fields, you can add them and use the format that best fits your needs.  These steps are usually coded in a script. The Flickr Person\nFinder projects provides a template for the task-creator that can be\nre-used without any problems (check the createTasks.py script).

The command allows you to:\n\n\n\n\ncreate projects, \n\n\nadd tasks from a CSV, Excel or JSON file, \n\n\nshow progress when adding tasks\n\n\ndelete tasks,\n\n\nupdated redundancy for tasks, \n\n\nand update the project templates.\n\n\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nPBS is available in Pypi so that you can install the software with pip:\n\n\n1\npip install pybossa-pbs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nWe recommend to use virtual environments to install new Python libraries and packages, so please, before installing the PBS command line tool consider using a virtual environment.\n\n\n\n\nIf you have all the dependencies, the package will be installed, and you will be able to use it from the command line. The command is \npbs\n.\n\n\nConfiguring PBS\n\n\nBy default, PBS does not need a config file. However, you will have to specify for every command the server and your API key to add tasks, create a project, etc. For determining the server and API key\nthat you want to use, all you have to do is pass it as an argument:\n\n\n1\npbs --server http://server.com --api-key yourkey subcommand\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you work with two or more servers, then, remembering all the keys, and server URLs could be problematic, as well as you will be leaving a trace in your BASH history file. For this reason, pbs has a\nconfiguration file where you can add all the servers that you are\nworking with.\n\n\nTo create the config file, all you have to do is creating a\n\n.pybossa.cfg\n file in your home folder:\n\n\n1\n2\ncd\n ~\nvim .pybossa.cfg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe file should have the following structure:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n[\ndefault\n]\n\n\nserver\n:\n \nhttps\n:\n//\ntheserver\n.\ncom\n\n\napikey\n:\n \nyourkey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are working with more servers, add another section below it. For example:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n[\ndefault\n]\n\n\nserver\n:\n \nhttps\n:\n//\ntheserver\n.\ncom\n\n\napikey\n:\n \nyourkey\n\n\n\n[\nyourserver\n]\n\n\nserver\n:\n \nhttps\n:\n//\nyourserver\n.\norg\n\n\napikey\n:\n \nyourkeyinyourserver\n.\norg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, pbs will use the credentials of the default section, so you don\nt have to type anything to use those values. However, if you want to do actions on another server, all you have to do is the following:\n\n\n1\npbs --credentials yourserver --help\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat command will use the values of the yourserver section.\n\n\nProject\n\n\nThis section shows how you can handle a project using PBS.\n\n\nCreating a project\n\n\nCreating a project is very simple. All you have to do is create a file\nnamed \nproject.json\n with the following fields:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n{\n\n    \nname\n:\n \nFlickr Person Finder\n,\n\n    \nshort_name\n:\n \nflickrperson\n,\n\n    \ndescription\n:\n \nImage pattern recognition\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you use the name \nproject.json\n you will not have to pass the file\nname via an argument, as it\ns the name used by default. Once you have the file created, run the following command:\n\n\n1\npbs create_project\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat command should create the project. If you want to see all the\navailable options, please check the \nhelp\n command:\n\n\n1\npbs create_project --help\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating templates\n\n\nNow that you have added tasks, you can work in your templates. All you have to do to add/update the templates of your project is running the following command:\n\n\n1\npbs update_project\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat command needs to have in the same folder where you are running it, the following files:\n\n\n\n\ntemplate.html\n\n\nresults.html\n\n\nlong_description.md\n\n\ntutorial.html\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to use another template, just use these arguments:\n\n\n1\npbs update_project --template /tmp/template.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to see all the available options, please check the\n\nhelp\n command:\n\n\n1\npbs update_project --help\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing an external JavaScript file\n\n\nSince PBS \n= 2.3.0, PBS will check for an external JavaScript file named \nbundle.js\n or \nbundle.min.js\n. If any of those files exist, then, they will be added at the bottom of your template (like you have been doing so far with your projects).\n\n\nThis solution allows you to use for example webpack plus babel to transpile your code, minimize it and add it to your PYBOSSA project.\n\n\nTo use this solution, just transpile to a file named bundle.js or bundle.min.js.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf there\ns a minified version of the file, bundle.min.js, that file will always be used instead of bundle.js. \n\n\n\n\nAuto-updating while developing a PYBOSSA project\n\n\nAt some point, you will end up running lots of PBS update_project commands, as you will be using your chosen editor for fixing CSS, HTML or JavaScript. For these scenarios, PBS comes with a handy flag: \nwatch\n. This argument will tell PBS to run the update_project command automatically when bundle.js, bundle.min.js, template.html, tutorial.html or long_description.md are modified in the file system. As simple as that.\n\n\nYou can run it like this:\n\n\n1\n    pbs update_project --watch\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the output will be similar to this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing webpack and PBS\n\n\nThis also works with bundle.js files. Thus, you can have webpack transpiling automatically your code, and PBS will update your project with the new code. Cheers \n\n\n\n\nTasks\n\n\nThis section shows how you can handle project\ns tasks.\n\n\nAdding tasks to a project\n\n\nAdding tasks is very simple. You can have your tasks in these formats:\n\n\n\n\nJSON\n\n\nCSV\n\n\nExcel (xlsx from 2010. It imports the first sheet)\n\n\nPO (any po file that you want to translate)\n\n\nPROPERTIES (any PROPERTIES file that you want to translate)\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, adding tasks to your project is as simple as this command:\n\n\n1\npbs add_tasks --tasks-file tasks_file.json\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to see all the available options, please check the\n\nhelp\n command:\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nBy default, PYBOSSA servers use a rate limit for avoiding abuse of the API. For this reason, you can only do usually 300 requests per every 15 minutes. If you are going to add more than 300 tasks, pbs will detect it and warn you, auto-enabling the throttling for you to respect the limits. Please, see \nthe rate-limiting section\n for more details.\n\n\n\n\n1\npbs add_tasks --help\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating tasks redundancy from a project\n\n\nIf you need it, you can update the redundancy of a task using its ID or all the tasks skipping the ID. For example, to update the redundancy of one task to 5:\n\n\n1\n    pbs update-task-redundancy --task-id \n34234\n --redundancy \n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo update all of them:\n\n\n1\n    pbs update-task-redundancy --redundancy \n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nWithout the \nredundancy\n argument it will revert the redundancy to the default value: 30.\n\n\n\n\nThis last command will confirm that you want to update all the tasks.\n\n\nIf you want to see all the available options, please check the \nhelp\n command:\n\n\n1\n    pbs update-task-redundancy --help\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeleting tasks from a project\n\n\nIf you need it, you can delete all the tasks from your project, or only one using its task.id. For removing all the tasks, all you\nve to do is\nrun the following command:\n\n\n1\npbs delete_tasks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis command will confirm that you want to delete all the tasks and\nassociated task_runs.\n\n\nIf you want to see all the available options, please check the\n\nhelp\n command:\n\n\n1\npbs delete_tasks --help\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nOnly tasks that are not associated with a result will be deleted.\n\n\n\n\nGetting out of the API context\n\n\nPYBOSSA by default returns first your projects, meaning that if you want to work on a project that you don\nt own, it will return an error as the project will not be found. For solving this issue you have two options:\n\n\n\n\nIn the config file, by adding a new flag: all:1\n\n\nOn the command line, passing the \nall=1 flag\n\n\n\n\nHelping Materials\n\n\nThis section shows how you can handle project\ns helping materials.\n\n\nAdding helping materials to a project\n\n\nAdding helping materials is very simple. You can have your materials in three formats:\n\n\n\n\nJSON\n\n\nExcel (xlsx from 2010. It imports the first sheet)\n\n\nCSV\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, adding helping materials to your project is as simple as this command:\n\n\n1\n2\n    pbs add_helpingmaterials\n    --helping-materials-lfile file.xlsx --helping-type xlsx\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to see all the available options, please check the \nhelp\n command:\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nBy default, PYBOSSA servers use a rate limit for avoiding abuse of the API. For this reason, you can only do usually 300 requests per every 15 minutes. If you are going to add more than 300 tasks, pbs will detect it and warn you, auto-enabling the throttling for you to respect the limits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nPYBOSSA helping materials allow you to upload media files like videos, images, or sounds to support your project tutorials. The command line PBS will check for a column in your file with the name \nfile_path\n so it can upload it first to the server. Please, be sure that the file (or files) path is reachable from the helping materials file.\n\n\n\n\n1\n    pbs add_helpingmaterials --help",

            "text": "Project Tutorial\n\n\nThis tutorial uses the demo project \nFlickr Person\n (\nsource\ncode\n) built by Scifabric for PYBOSSA. This demo is a simple microtasking project where users have to answer the following question: \nDo you see a human face in this photo?\n The possible answers are: \nYes, No\n and \nI don\nt know\n. In other words, this is an example of a simple crowdsourcing project for image classification.\n\n\nThe demo project Flickr Person has two main components:\n\n\n\n\nA Python script that creates the tasks in\n  PYBOSSA using the Flickr API, and\n\n\nthe task-presenter: an HTML + Javascript structure that will show\n  the tasks to the users and save their answers.\n\n\n\n\nThis tutorial uses the PYBOSSA \npbs command line tool\n as it will show you how you can handle your project from the command line like a pro.\n\n\nSetting Things Up\n\n\nTo run the tutorial, you will need to create an account in a\nPYBOSSA server. The PYBOSSA server could be running on your computer or in a third party server.\n\n\nOnce you have a PYBOSSA account, you will have access to your profile by clicking on your name, and then on the \nMy Settings\n section. There, you will find your API-KEY.\n\n\n\n\nThis \nAPI-KEY\n will identify and authenticate you via the PYBOSSA API. It will allow you to create a project, add tasks, update the project, etc. As you will be the owner of the project, only you will be able to perform these actions, but anyone will be able to participate in your project.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis tutorial uses the \npbs command line tool\n. You need to install it in your system before proceeding. Please, check the \npbs documentation for more information\n.\n\n\n\n\nCreating the Project\n\n\nThere are two possible methods for creating a project:\n\n\n\n\nweb-interface: click on your username, and you will see a section\n  named \nprojects\n list. In that section, you will be able to create a project using the web interface.\n\n\nAPI-interface: using the \npbs\n command line tool.\n\n\n\n\nFor this tutorial, we are going to use the second option. The reason is that via the API you will have more flexibility than via the web interface.\n\n\nTherefore, for creating the project, you will need two parameters:\n\n\n\n\nthe URL of the PYBOSSA server, and\n\n\nan API-KEY to authenticate yourself in the PYBOSSA server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nIf you are running a PYBOSSA server locally, you can omit the URL parameter as by default it uses the URL \nhttp://localhost:5000\n.\n\n\n\n\nGetting the project\ns source code\n\n\nNow that we know where are we going to create the project (the server URL) and that we have an API key,  we can download the source code of the project. To get the code, we will clone the \nFlickr\nPerson Finder Repository\n. This step will download all the code and scripts to your computer.\n\n\n\n\nTo clone the code, we will use Git. Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance.\n\n\nIf you are new to Git, we recommend you to take\nthis \nfree and on-line course\n (it will take you\nonly 15 minutes!) where you will learn the basics, which are the main\nconcepts that you will need for cloning the demo project repository.\n\n\nIf you prefer to skip the course and take it in a later stage, the\ncommands that you need to clone the repository are:\n\n\n1\ngit clone git://github.com/Scifabric/app-flickrperson.git\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter running that command,  a new folder named \napp-flickrperson\n will be created from where you run the command.\n\n\nConfiguring the name, short name, thumbnail, etc.\n\n\nThe Flickr Person Finder provides a file called \nproject.json\n that has the following content:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n{\n\n    \nname\n:\n \nFlickr Person Finder\n,\n\n    \nshort_name\n:\n \nflickrperson\n,\n\n    \ndescription\n:\n \nImage pattern recognition\n,\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis file, project.json identifies your project. It has its name, as well as a short description about it. As we are creating a new project, please, modify the \nname\n and \nshort_name\n to make it yours.\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nThe \nname\n and \nshort_name\n of the project \nmust be unique\n! Otherwise, you will get an error (IntegrityError) when creating the project.\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n will be the text shown in the project listing page. It\ns important that you try to have a short description that explains what your project does.\n\n\nNow that we have the \nproject.json\n file ready, we can create the\nproject:\n\n\n1\npbs --server server --api-key key create_project\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis command will read the values from the \nproject.json\n file and use them to create a draft project in the PYBOSSA server of your\nchoice.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou can save some typing if you create a config file for pbs. Please,\ncheck the \npbs page\n for more details.\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to check if the project exists, just open your web browser,\nand type in the following URL http://server/project/short_name\n\n\nWhere \nshort_name\n is the value of the key with the same name in the file: \nproject.json\n. You should get a project page. Now, let\ns add some tasks to the project.\n\n\nProviding more details about the project\n\n\nUp to now we have created the project, added some tasks, but the project still lacks a lot of information. For example, a welcome page (or long description) of the project, so the users can know what this project is about.\n\n\nIf you check the source code, you will see that there is a file named\n\nlong_description.md\n. This file has a lengthy description of the project, explaining different aspects of it.\n\n\nThis information is not mandatory. However it will be beneficial for\nthe users as they will get a bit more of information about the project\ngoals.\n\n\nThe file can be composed using Markdown or plain text.\n\n\nThe long description will be shown on the project home page:\n\n\n1\nhttps://yourserver/project/flickrperson\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to modify the description you have two options, edit it via the web interface, or change locally the \nlong_description.md\n file and run pbs to update it:\n\n\n1\npbs update_project\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding an icon to the project\n\n\nIt is possible also to add a nice icon for the project. By default\nPYBOSSA will render a 100x100 pixels empty thumbnail for those projects that do not provide it.\n\n\nIf you want to add an icon you can do it by using the web interface.\nJust go to the \nSettings\n tab within your project. There, select the\nimage file you want to use and push the \nUpload\n button. That\ns all!\n\n\nProtecting the project with a password\n\n\nIf for any reason, you want to allow only certain people to contribute\nto your project, you can set a password. Thus, every time a user (either anonymous or authenticated) wants to contribute to the project, it will be asked to introduce the password. The user will then be able to contribute to the project for 30 minutes (this is a value by default, can be changed in every PYBOSSA server). After this time, the user will be asked again to introduce the password if the user wants to continue contributing, and so on.\n\n\nAdding tasks to the project\n\n\nNow that we have the project created, we can add some tasks to it. PYBOSSA will deliver the tasks for the users (authenticated and\nanonymous ones) and store the submitted answers in the PYBOSSA database so that you can process them in a later stage.\n\n\nA PYBOSSA task is a JSON object with the information that needs to be processed by the volunteers. Usually, it will be a link to a media file (image, video, sound clip, PDF file, etc.) that needs to be processed.\n\n\nPYBOSSA does not store any data; it only links data in the tasks\n. This feature is really cool as you will always have control of the data. \n\n\nWhile PYBOSSA internally uses JSON for storing the data, you can add  tasks to your project using several formats:\n\n\n\n\nCSV: a comma-separated spreadsheet-\n\n\nExcel: xlsx from 2010. It imports the first sheet).\n\n\nJSON: a lightweight data-interchange format.\n\n\nPO (any po file that you want to translate).\n\n\nPROPERTIES (any PROPERTIES file that you want to translate).\n\n\n\n\nThe demo project comes with a CSV sample file, which has the following structure:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nquestion\n\n\nurl_m\n\n\nlink\n\n\nurl_b\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you see a human face in this photo?\n\n\nhttp://srv/img_m.jpg\n\n\nhttp://srv/img\n\n\nhttp://srv/img_b.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally there is a script named: \nget_images.py\n that will\ncontact Flickr, get the latest published photos to this web service, and\nsave them in JSON format as a file (flickr_tasks.json), with the same\nstructure as the CSV file (the keys are the same):\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n{\n \nlink\n:\n \nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/teleyinex/2945647308/\n,\n\n  \nurl_m\n:\n \nhttp://farm4.staticflickr.com/3208/2945647308_f048cc1633_m.jpg\n,\n \n  \nurl_b\n:\n \nhttp://farm4.staticflickr.com/3208/2945647308_f048cc1633_b.jpg\n \n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nFlickr creates from the original image different cropped versions of the image. It uses a pattern to distinguish them: \n_m\n for medium size, and \n_b\n for the big ones. There are more options, so if you need more help in this matter, check the official \nFlickr    documentation\n.\n\n\n\n\nAs we have a CSV file with some tasks, let\ns use it for adding some\ntasks to your project. For adding tasks using the CSV file,  all you have to do is the following:\n\n\n1\npbs add_tasks --tasks-file flickr_tasks.csv\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter running this command, you will see a progress bar that will let\nyou know when all the tasks have been added to your project. This has been really easy, right? As you can see, adding tasks to a project is really straightforward if you have a CSV or Excel file. Each row will become a task in PYBOSSA, and you only have to run one command to get all of them into your project.\n\n\nAs a bonus, let\ns also add some tasks using the \nget_images.py\n script. This script will contact Flickr, get the last 20 published photos, and then, save them in JSON format into a file called \nflickr_tasks.json\n.  By doing this, we are showing you how you can easily extract data from third-party services and import them into a PYBOSSA project. Thus, let\ns start by running the command and getting the tasks:\n\n\n1\npython get_images.py\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat command has created the file: \nflickr_tasks.json\n. Now, let\ns use it to add the pictures to our project:\n\n\n1\npbs add_tasks --tasks-file flickr_tasks.json\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDone! Again, a progress bar will show us how long it takes to add all\nthe tasks. Now that we have all the tasks in the project, we can work on the next step: presenting the tasks to the volunteers.\n\n\nTask\ns redundancy\n\n\nPYBOSSA by default will send a task to different users (authenticated \nand anonymous users) until 30 different task runs are obtained for each task. This is usually known as \nredundancy\n, and we will use it to validate the analysis of the task. The whole aim of this value is to avoid trolls to participate several times in the same task, answering wrong on purpose so that we can have a valid statistical analysis of the submitted contributions by the volunteers.\n\n\nPYBOSSA does not allow the same user to submit more than one\nanswer (task runs in PYBOSSA lingo) to the same task. PYBOSSA identifies anonymous users via their IP, while registered users via their PYBOSSA id.\n\n\nWhy PYBOSSA uses a default value of 30? Well, because we are getting 30 observations for a task, and if the data is normal, at least 30 samples should be obtained to get that model. In any case, you can easily change this value for each, using the task settings section of your project (or via the API using the \npbs\n tool). \n\n\nIf you want to improve the quality of the results for one task and get more confidence in the data when you will analyze it, you can modify the redundancy value with the pbs command. For example, to reduce the number of users that will analyze each task to ten, run the following command:\n\n\n1\npbs add_tasks --tasks-file file --redundancy \n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, the \nn_answers\n field will instruct PYBOSSA to send the task to 10 different users.\n\n\nTasks\ns priority\n\n\nEvery task can have its own \npriority\n. You can modify it using the web interface, or the API.\n\n\nA task with a higher priority will be delivered first to the volunteers.\nHence if you have a project where you need to analyze a task first due to an external event (a new data sample has been obtained), then you can modify the priority of the newly created task and deliver it first.\n\n\nIf you have a new batch of tasks, instead of only a task, that needs to be processed before all the available ones, you can do it with pbs as well. Run the following command:\n\n\n1\npbs add_tasks --tasks-file file --priority \n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe priority is a number between 0.0 and 1.0. The highest priority is\n1.0 and the lowest is 0.0.\n\n\nPresenting the Tasks to the user\n\n\nNow that we have the tasks in our project, we have to present them to the user. For achieving this, you will have to create an HTML\ntemplate.\n\n\nThe template is the skeleton that will be used to load the data of the\ntasks: the question, the photos, user progress, input fields \n submit\nbuttons to solve the task.\n\n\nIn this tutorial, Flickr Person uses a basic HTML skeleton and the\n\nPYBOSSA.JS\n library to load the data of the tasks into the HTML template and take actions based on the users\n answers.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nWhen an authenticated user submits a task, the task will save the user ID. For anonymous users, the submitted task will only have the user IP address.\n\n\n\n\nThe HTML Skeleton\n\n\nThe \nfile\n\n\ntemplate.html\n has the skeleton to show the tasks. The file has three sections:\n\n\n\n\nA div for the warnings actions\n. When the user saves an   answer, a success feedback message is shown to the user. There is\n  also an error one for the failures.\n\n\nA div for the Flickr image\n. This div will be populated\n  with the task photo URL and LINK data.\n\n\nA div for the Questions \n Answer buttons\n. There are\n  three buttons with the possible answers: \nYes\n, \nNo\n, and \nI don\nt\n  know\n.\n\n\n\n\nBy default, PYBOSSA includes the PYBOSSA.JS\nlibrary, so you don\nt have to include it in your template.\n\n\nAll you have to do is to add a script section where you will be loading\nthe tasks and saving the answers from the users: \n.\n\n\nThis template file will be used by the pbs command line tool to add the task presenter to the project. You can add it running the following command:\n\n\n1\npbs update_project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou can also edit the HTML skeleton using the web interface. Once the project has been created in PYBOSSA you will see a button that\nallows you to edit the skeleton using a WYSIWYG editor.\n\n\n\n\nIn PYBOSSA every project has a \ntask presenter\n endpoint: http://PYBOSSA-SERVER/project/SLUG/newtask\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe \nslug\n is the short name for the project, in this case\n\nflickrperson\n.\n\n\n\n\nLoading the above endpoint will load the skeleton and trigger the\nJavaScript functions to get a task from the PYBOSSA server and populate it in the HTML skeleton.\n\n\nThe header and footer for the presenter are already provided by PYBOSSA, so the template only has to define the structure to present the data from the tasks to the users and the action buttons, input methods, etc. to retrieve and save the answer from the volunteers.\n\n\nFlickr Person Skeleton\n\n\nFor this tutorial, we have a very simple DOM. At the\nbeginning you will find a big div that will be used to show some\nmessages to the user about the success of an action, for instance, that an answer has been saved or that a new task is being loaded.

First, we will need to check that we are not getting an empty object, as it will mean that there are no more available tasks for the current user. In that case, we should hide the skeleton, and say thanks to the user as he has participated in all the tasks of the project.\n\n\nIf the task object is not empty, then we have a task to load into the\n\nskeleton\n. In this demo project, we will update the\nquestion, adding the photo to the DOM, refreshing the user progress and add some actions to the submission buttons so we can save the answer of the volunteer.\n\n\nThe PYBOSSA.JS library treats the user input as an \nasync function.\n\nThis is why the function gets a deferred object, as this object will be\nresolved\n when the user clicks on one of the possible answers. We use this approach to load in the background the next task for the user while the volunteer is solving the current one.

This method is in charge of getting the user\nthe progress of the user and update the progress bar accordingly:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\nfunction\n \nloadUserProgress\n()\n \n{\n\n    \npybossa\n.\nuserProgress\n(\nflickrperson\n).\ndone\n(\nfunction\n(\ndata\n){\n\n        \nvar\n \npct\n \n=\n \nMath\n.\nround\n((\ndata\n.\ndone\n*\n100\n)\n/\ndata\n.\ntotal\n);\n\n        \n$\n(\n#progress\n).\ncss\n(\nwidth\n,\n \npct\n.\ntoString\n()\n \n+\n%\n);\n\n        \n$\n(\n#progress\n).\nattr\n(\ntitle\n,\n \npct\n.\ntoString\n()\n \n+\n \n% completed!\n);\n\n        \n$\n(\n#progress\n).\ntooltip\n({\nplacement\n:\n \nleft\n});\n \n        \n$\n(\n#total\n).\ntext\n(\ndata\n.\ntotal\n);\n\n        \n$\n(\n#done\n).\ntext\n(\ndata\n.\ndone\n);\n\n    \n});\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can update the code only to show the number of answers, or remove it entirely. However, the volunteers will benefit from this type of information as they will be able to know how many tasks they have to do, giving an idea of progress while they contribute to the project.\n\n\nFinally, we only need in our code to tell pybossa.js to run our project:\n\n\n1\npybossa\n.\nrun\n(\nflickrperson\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaving the answer\n\n\nOnce the task has been presented, users can click on the answer\nbuttons: \nYes\n, \nNo\n or \nI don\nt know\n.\n\n\nYes\n and \nNo\n save the answer in the DB with information about the task and the answer, while the button \nI don\nt know\n loads another task as sometimes the image is not available.\n\n\nTo submit and save the answer from the user, we will use again\nthe PYBOSSA.JS library. In this case:\n\n\n1\npybossa\n.\nsaveTask\n(\n \ntaskid\n,\n \nanswer\n \n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \npybossa.saveTask\n method saves an answer for a given task. In the previous section, we show that in the pybossa.presentTask method the \ntask-id\n can be obtained, as we will be passing the object to saveTask method.\n\n\nThe method allows us to give a successful pop-up feedback for the user, so you can use the following structure to warn the user and tell him that his answer has been successfully saved:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\npybossa\n.\nsaveTask\n(\n \ntaskid\n,\n \nanswer\n \n).\ndone\n(\n\n  \nfunction\n(\n \ndata\n \n)\n \n{\n\n      \n// Show the feedback div\n\n      \n$\n(\n#success\n).\nfadeIn\n();\n \n      \n// Fade out the pop-up after a 1000 miliseconds\n\n      \nsetTimeout\n(\nfunction\n()\n \n{\n \n$\n(\n#success\n).\nfadeOut\n()\n \n},\n \n1000\n);\n\n  \n};\n\n\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeeping track of the time spent by volunteers solving a task\n\n\nSince v1.1.3, PYBOSSA records a timestamp, for every task run, of the contributed task runs. This is stored in the \ncreated\n attribute of the Task Runs.\n\n\nNow, with the \nfinish_time\n attribute, we will be able to know how\nmuch time the volunteer has spent completing the task: (time spent =\nfinish_time - created)\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nThis information is only shown to the owner of the project.\n\n\n\n\nUpdating the template for all the tasks\n\n\nIt is possible to update the template of the project without having to re-create the project and its tasks. To update the template,\nyou only have to modify the file \ntemplate.html\n and run the following command:\n\n\n1\npbs update_project\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also use the web interface to do it, and see the changes in real time before saving the results. Check your project page, go to the tasks section, and look for the \nEdit the task presenter\n button.\n\n\nTesting the task presenter\n\n\nTo test the project task presenter, go to the following URL     http://PYBOSSA-SERVER/project/SLUG/presenter\n\n\nThe presenter will load one task, and you will be able to submit and\nsave one answer for the current task.\n\n\nPublishing the project\n\n\nUntil now, the project has been in testing mode. This means that you can play with your project as much as you want. You can invite a few friends or colleauges to test it, just to know that everything works. \n\n\nIn this mode PYBOSSA will work as a published project, so you can test it, however, it is not published so it\ns not visible to users on the server unless you share the link to it. \n\n\nOnce you are happy, you can publish the project. When you publish the project, PYBOSSA will clean your tests and leave it clean for your contributors. Thus, don\nt be afraid and test as much as you want!\n\n\nTutorial\n\n\nIn general, users will like to have some feedback when accessing for the very first time your project. Usually, the overview page of your project will not be enough, so you can build a tutorial (a web page) that will explain to the volunteer how he can participate in the\nproject.\n\n\nPYBOSSA will detect if the user is accessing for the very first time\nyour project, so in that case, it will load the \ntutorial\n, if your project has one.\n\n\nAdding a tutorial is simple: you only have to create a file named\n\ntutorial.html\n and load the content of the file using pbs:\n\n\n1\npbs update_project\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tutorial could have whatever you like: videos, nice animations, etc. PYBOSSA will render for you the header and the footer, so you only have to focus on the content. You can copy the template.html file and use it as a draft of your tutorial or just include a video of yourself explaining why your project is important and how, as a volunteer, you can contribute.\n\n\nIf your project has a tutorial, you can access it directly in\nthis endpoint:\n\n\n1\nhttp://server/project/tutorial\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvance tutorial (helping materials)\n\n\nWhile the previous solution works for most of the projects, your project might need something special: visual clues so users can easily identify sounds, patterns, etc. easily. The default tutorial does not allow you to curate/create a list of helping materials that could be used directly in the presenter to explain how for example you can identify cancer cells, or specific species of animals.\n\n\nFor this reason, PYBOSSA now supports an API endpoint for helping\nmaterials: api/helpingmaterial.\n\n\nThis endpoint allows you to add JSON and media files (images, videos or sounds) that you can use within your project to build an interactive tutorial.\n\n\nHelping materials allow you to upload images via the endpoint using the multipart/form-data Content-Type.\n\n\nFor example, imagine that you want to add a photo of an animal and it\ns description, so users can easily identify it (or use it as pre-loaded\nanswer for classifying pictures of animals). In this case, you can do\nthe following (using the popular Python requests library, but you can\nuse any other programming language):\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\nimport\n \nrequests\n\n\nurl\n \n=\n \nhttps://server/api/helpingpoint?api_key=YOURKEY\n\n\n# Upload a picture\n\n\nfiles\n \n=\n \n{\nfile\n:\n \nopen\n(\ntest.jpg\n,\n \nrb\n)}\n\n\ndata\n \n=\n \n{\nproject_id\n:\n \nYOURPROJECT_ID\n}\n\n\nr\n \n=\n \nrequests\n.\npost\n(\nurl\n,\n \ndata\n=\ndata\n,\n \nfiles\n=\nfiles\n)\n\n\n# Get the created helping material\n\n\nhp\n \n=\n \nr\n.\njson\n()\n\n\n# Add the meta-data of the picture\n\n\nurl\n \n=\n \nhttps://server/api/helpingpoint/\n%s\n?api_key=YOURKEY\n \n%\n \nhp\n[\nid\n]\n\n\ninfo\n \n=\n \n{\npopular_name\n:\n \nelephant\n,\n \nscientific_name\n:\n \nloxodonta\n}\n\n\nr\n \n=\n \nrequests\n.\nput\n(\nurl\n,\n \njson\n=\n{\ninfo\n:\n \ninfo\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can add as many files as you want. Then, from any place you can\nquery the helping material endpoint to retrieve the example/tutorial\nmaterials for helping your users.\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nPBS and helping materials\n     You can use PBS to add helping materials from an Excel or CSV file. Check the \ndocumentation\n.\n\n\nProviding some I18n support\n\n\nSometimes, you may want to provide the task interface in their language. To support this, you can access their locale via Javascript in an effortless way, as we\nve placed the user locale in a hidden \ndiv\n node:\n\n\n1\nvar\n \nuserLocale\n \n=\n \ndocument\n.\ngetElementById\n(\nPYBOSSA_USER_LOCALE\n).\ntextContent\n.\ntrim\n();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe way you use it after that is up to you. But let\ns see an example of\nhow you can use it to make a tutorial that automatically shows the\nstrings in the locale of the user.\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nAnonymous users will be only shown with \nen\n language by default. This feature only works for authenticated users that choose their locale in their account. You can, however, load the translated strings using the browser preferred language.\n\n\n\n\nFirst of all, check the \ntutorial.html file\n. You will see it consists on some HTML plus some Javascript inside a script tag to handle the different steps of the tutorial. Here you have a snippet of HTML tutorial file:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\ndiv\n \nclass\n=\nrow\n\n    \ndiv\n \nclass\n=\ncol-md-12\n\n        \ndiv\n \nid\n=\nmodal\n \nclass\n=\nmodal hide fade\n\n            \ndiv\n \nclass\n=\nmodal-header\n\n                \nh3\nFlickr Person Finder tutorial\n/\nh3\n\n            \n/\ndiv\n\n            \ndiv\n \nid\n=\n0\n \nclass\n=\nmodal-body\n \nstyle\n=\ndisplay:none\n\n                \np\nstrong\nHi!\n/\nstrong\n This is a \nstrong\ndemo project\n/\nstrong\n that shows how you can do pattern recognition on pictures or images using the PYBOSSA framework.\n               \n/\np\n\n            \n/\ndiv\n\n            \ndiv\n \nid\n=\n1\n \nclass\n=\nmodal-body\n \nstyle\n=\ndisplay:none\n\n                \np\nThe project is really simple.

It\ns\nvital that you place there the IDs you\nve given to the different translated versions of your HTML for the tutorial. The rest of the\nscript will only compare the locale of the user that is seeing the\ntutorial and delete all the HTML that is not in his language, so that\nonly the tutorial that fits his locale settings is shown.\n\n\nAnother method to support I18n\n\n\nAnother option for translating your project to different languages is\nusing a JSON object like this:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\nmessages\n \n=\n \n{\nen\n:\n \n               \n{\nwelcome\n:\n \nHello World!,\n\n\n                \nbye\n: \nGood\n \nbye\n!\n\n\n               },\n\n\n            \nes\n:\n\n               \n{\nwelcome\n:\n \nHola mundo!\n,\n\n                \nbye\n:\n \nHasta luego!\n\n               \n}\n\n           \n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis object can be placed in the \ntutorial.html\n or \ntemplate.html\n file to load the proper strings translated to your users.\n\n\nThe logic is very simple. With the following code you grab the language that should be loaded for the current user:\n\n\n1\nvar\n \nuserLocale\n \n=\n \ndocument\n.\ngetElementById\n(\nPYBOSSA_USER_LOCALE\n).\ntextContent\n.\ntrim\n();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, use userLocale to load the strings. For example, for\n\ntemplate.html\n and the Flickrperson demo project, you will find the\nfollowing code at the start of the script:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n// Default language\n\n\nvar\n \nuserLocale\n \n=\n \nen\n;\n\n\n// Translations\n\n\nvar\n \nmessages\n \n=\n \n{\nen\n:\n \n{\n\n                        \ni18n_welldone\n:\n \nWell done!\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_welldone_text\n:\n \nYour answer has been saved\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_loading_next_task\n:\n \nLoading next task...\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_task_completed\n:\n \nThe task has been completed!\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_thanks\n:\n \nThanks a lot!\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_congratulations\n:\n \nCongratulations\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_congratulations_text\n:\n \nYou have participated in all available tasks!\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_yes\n:\n \nYes\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_no_photo\n:\n \nNo photo\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_i_dont_know\n:\n \nI don\nt know\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_working_task\n:\n \nYou are working now on task:\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_tasks_completed\n:\n \nYou have completed:\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_tasks_from\n:\n \ntasks from\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_show_comments\n:\n \nShow comments:\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_hide_comments\n:\n \nHide comments:\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_question\n:\n \nDo you see a human face in this photo?\n,\n\n                      \n},\n\n                \nes\n:\n \n{\n\n                        \ni18n_welldone\n:\n \nBien hecho!\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_welldone_text\n:\n \nTu respuesta ha sido guardada\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_loading_next_task\n:\n \nCargando la siguiente tarea...\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_task_completed\n:\n \nLa tarea ha sido completadas!\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_thanks\n:\n \nMuch\u00edsimas gracias!\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_congratulations\n:\n \nEnhorabuena\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_congratulations_text\n:\n \nHas participado en todas las tareas disponibles!\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_yes\n:\n \nS\u00ed\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_no_photo\n:\n \nNo hay foto\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_i_dont_know\n:\n \nNo lo s\u00e9\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_working_task\n:\n \nEst\u00e1s trabajando en la tarea:\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_tasks_completed\n:\n \nHas completado:\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_tasks_from\n:\n \ntareas de\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_show_comments\n:\n \nMostrar comentarios\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_hide_comments\n:\n \nOcultar comentarios\n,\n\n                        \ni18n_question\n:\n \n\u00bfVes una cara humana en esta foto?\n,\n\n                      \n},\n\n               \n};\n\n\n// Update userLocale with server side information\n\n \n$\n(\ndocument\n).\nready\n(\nfunction\n(){\n\n     \nuserLocale\n \n=\n \ndocument\n.\ngetElementById\n(\nPYBOSSA_USER_LOCALE\n).\ntextContent\n.\ntrim\n();\n\n\n\n});\n\n\n\nfunction\n \ni18n_translate\n()\n \n{\n\n    \nvar\n \nids\n \n=\n \nObject\n.\nkeys\n(\nmessages\n[\nuserLocale\n])\n\n    \nfor\n \n(\ni\n=\n0\n;\n \ni\nids\n.\nlength\n;\n \ni\n++\n)\n \n{\n\n        \nconsole\n.\nlog\n(\nTranslating: \n \n+\n \nids\n[\ni\n]);\n\n        \ndocument\n.\ngetElementById\n(\nids\n[\ni\n]).\ninnerHTML\n \n=\n \nmessages\n[\nuserLocale\n][\nids\n[\ni\n]];\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we define the default locale, \nen\n for English. Then, we create a\nmessages dictionary with all the ids that we want to translate. Finally, we add the languages that we want to support.\n\n\nAs you can see, it\ns quite simple as you can share the messages object with your volunteers so that you can get many more translations for your project smoothly.\n\n\nFinally, we need actually to load those translated strings into the\ntemplate. For doing this step, all we\nve to do is adding the following\ncode to our \ntemplate.html\n file at the function pybossa.presentTask:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\npybossa\n.\npresentTask\n(\nfunction\n(\ntask\n,\n \ndeferred\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nif\n \n(\n \n!\n$\n.\nisEmptyObject\n(\ntask\n)\n \n)\n \n{\n\n        \nloadUserProgress\n();\n\n        \ni18n_translate\n();\n\n        \n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDone! When the task is loaded, the strings are translated and the\nproject will be shown in the user language.\n\n\nUpdating project\ns status\n\n\nYou can share the progress of the project creating a blog. Every PYBOSSA project includes a blog where you will be able to write about your project regularly.\n\n\nYou can use Markdown or plain text for the content of the posts. And you will also be able to edit them or delete after creation if you want.\n\n\nTo write a post go to the project \nSettings\n tab and there you\nwill find an option to write, read or delete your blog posts.\n\n\nYou can use the endpoint /api/blogpost to also add blogposts, update\nthem and delete them. The api endpoint allows you as well to upload a picture to your blogpost.\n\n\nThis endpoint allows you to add JSON and media files (images, videos or sounds) that you can use with your blogpost.\n\n\nYou can use this endpoint for uploading images via the endpoint using the multipart/form-data Content-Type.\n\n\nFor example, imagine that you want to add a photo as a cover and then the body of the blogpost. In this case, you can do the following (using the popular Python requests library, but you can use any other\nprogramming language):\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\nimport\n \nrequests\n\n\nurl\n \n=\n \nhttps://server/api/blogpost?api_key=YOURKEY\n\n\n# Upload a picture\n\n\nfiles\n \n=\n \n{\nfile\n:\n \nopen\n(\ntest.jpg\n,\n \nrb\n)}\n\n\ndata\n \n=\n \n{\nproject_id\n:\n \nYOURPROJECT_ID\n,\n \ntitle\n=\ntitle\n,\n \nbody\n=\nbody\n}\n\n\nr\n \n=\n \nrequests\n.\npost\n(\nurl\n,\n \ndata\n=\ndata\n,\n \nfiles\n=\nfiles\n)\n\n\n# Get the created blogpost\n\n\nbp\n \n=\n \nr\n.\njson\n()\n\n\n# Update the body with the meta-data of the picture\n\n\nurl\n \n=\n \nhttps://server/api/blogpost/\n%s\n?api_key=YOURKEY\n \n%\n \nbp\n[\nid\n]\n\n\nbody\n \n=\n \nhello ![img](\n%s\n)\n \n%\n \nbp\n[\nmedia_url\n]\n\n\nr\n \n=\n \nrequests\n.\nput\n(\nurl\n,\n \njson\n=\n{\nbody\n:\n \nbody\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExporting the project\ns data\n\n\nYou can export all the available data  your project in three different ways:\n\n\n\n\nJSON\n, an open standard designed for human-readable data interchange, or\n\n\nCSV\n, a file\n    that stores tabular data (numbers and text) in plain-text form and\n    that can be opened with almost any spreadsheet software, or\n\n\nCKAN\n web server, a powerful data management\n    a system that makes data accessible \u2013by providing tools to streamline publishing, sharing, finding and using data.\n\n\n\n\nFor exporting the data, all you have to do is to visit the following URL\nin your web-browser:\n\n\n1\nhttp://PYBOSSA-SERVER/project/slug/tasks/export\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will find an interface that will allow you to export the Tasks, Task Runs and Results to \nJSON\n and \nCSV\n formats:\n\n\n\n\nThe previous methods will export all the tasks, results and task runs, \neven if they are not completed\n. When a task has been completed, in other words, when a task has collected the number of answers specified by the task (\nn_answers\n = 30 by default), a \nbrown button\n with the text \nDownload results\n will pop up, and if you click it all the answers for the given task will be shown in JSON format.\n\n\nYou can check which tasks are completed, in the following URL:\n\n\n1\nhttp://PYBOSSA-SERVER/project/slug\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd clicking on the \nTasks\n link in the \nleft local navigation\n, and\nthen click in the \nBrowse\n box:\n\n\n\n\nThen you will see which tasks are completed, and which ones you can download in \nJSON\n format:\n\n\n\n\nYou could download the results also using the API. For example, you\ncould write a small script that gets the list of tasks that have been\ncompleted using this URL:\n\n\n1\nGET http://PYBOSSA-SERVER/api/task?state=completed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf your project has more than 20 tasks, then you will need to use the \nAPI pagination\n, as by default PYBOSSA API only returns the first 20 items.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have obtained the list of completed tasks, your script could\nstart requesting the collected answers for the given tasks:\n\n\n1\nGET http://PYBOSSA-SERVER/api/taskrun?task_id=TASK-ID\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat way you will be able to get all the submitted answers by the\nvolunteers for the given task.\n\n\nExporting the task, task runs and results in JSON\n\n\nFor the \nJSON\n format, you will get\nall the output as a file that your browser will download, named:\nshort_name_tasks.json for the tasks, and short_name_task_runs.json\nfor the task runs.\n\n\nExporting the task, task runs and results to a CSV file\n\n\nWhile for the \nCSV\n format, you will get a CSV file that will be automatically saved on your computer.\n\n\nExporting the task, task runs and results to a CKAN server\n\n\nIf the server has been configured to allow you to export your\nproject\ns data to a CKAN server, the owner of the project will see another box that will give you the option to export the data to the CKAN server.\n\n\nTo use this method, you will need to add the CKAN API-KEY\nassociated with your account, otherwise, you will not be able to export the data, and a warning message will let you know it.\n\n\nAdding the CKAN API-KEY is simple. You only need to create an\naccount in the supported CKAN server, check your profile and copy the API-KEY. Then, open your PYBOSSA account page, edit it and paste the key in the section \nExternal Services\n.\n\n\n\n\nThen, you will be able to export the data to the CKAN server\nand host it there.\n\n\nPublishing results of your project\n\n\nSince v1.2.0, PYBOSSA automatically creates \nempty\n results when a task is completed.\n\n\nFor example, imagine your project is asking the following question in a set of images: \nDo you see a triangle in this picture?\n The possible\nanswers are: yes and no.\n\n\nYour project has configured the task redundancy to 5, so five people will answer that question for a given image (or task). When the 5\nth\n person sends the answer, the server marks the task as completed, and it creates a result for the given task associating the answers, the task and the project:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n{\nid\n:\n \n1\n,\n\n \nproject_id\n:\n \n1\n,\n\n \ntask_id\n:\n \n1\n,\n\n \ntask_run_ids\n:\n \n[\n1\n,\n2\n,\n3\n,\n4\n,\n5\n],\n\n \ninfo\n:\n \nnull\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs in other PYBOSSA domain objects, a result has a JSON field named\n\ninfo\n that allows you to store the \nfinal result\n for that task\nusing the task_runs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Imagine that the five volunteers\nanswered: yes, then as you are the project owner you could update the info field with that value:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n{\nid\n:\n \n1\n,\n\n \nproject_id\n:\n \n1\n,\n\n \ntask_id\n:\n \n1\n,\n\n \ntask_run_ids\n:\n \n[\n1\n,\n2\n,\n3\n,\n4\n,\n5\n],\n\n \ninfo\n:\n \n{\ntriangle\n:\n \nyes\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe benefit of storing that information is that you can access these\ndata via the PYBOSSA API so you will be able to show the results, in\nyour result project section using the API.\n\n\nThis will allow you to build beautiful visualizations of your results on\nmaps, WebGL, etc.\n\n\nAPI Errors\n\n\nIf something goes wrong, you should get an error message similar to the following one:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n    \nERROR\n:\nroot\n:\npbclient\n.\ncreate_project\n\n    \n{\n\n        \naction\n:\n \nPOST\n,\n\n        \nexception_cls\n:\n \nIntegrityError\n,\n\n        \nexception_msg\n:\n \n(IntegrityError) duplicate key value violates unique constraint \\\nproject_name_key\\\n\\nDETAIL:  Key (name)=(Flickr Person Finder) already exists.\\n\n,\n\n        \nstatus\n:\n \nfailed\n,\n\n        \nstatus_code\n:\n \n415\n,\n\n        \ntarget\n:\n \nproject\n\n    \n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe error message will have the information regarding the problems it has found when using the API.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nSince version 2.0.1 PYBOSSA enforces API Rate Limiting, so you might exceed the number of allowed requests, getting a 429 error. Please see \nrate-limiting section\n.",

PYBOSSA will deliver the tasks for the users (authenticated and\nanonymous ones) and store the submitted answers in the PYBOSSA database so that you can process them in a later stage.  A PYBOSSA task is a JSON object with the information that needs to be processed by the volunteers. Usually, it will be a link to a media file (image, video, sound clip, PDF file, etc.) that needs to be processed.  PYBOSSA does not store any data; it only links data in the tasks . This feature is really cool as you will always have control of the data.   While PYBOSSA internally uses JSON for storing the data, you can add  tasks to your project using several formats:   CSV: a comma-separated spreadsheet-  Excel: xlsx from 2010. It imports the first sheet).  JSON: a lightweight data-interchange format.  PO (any po file that you want to translate).  PROPERTIES (any PROPERTIES file that you want to translate).   The demo project comes with a CSV sample file, which has the following structure:     question  url_m  link  url_b      Do you see a human face in this photo?  http://srv/img_m.jpg  http://srv/img  http://srv/img_b.jpg     Additionally there is a script named:  get_images.py  that will\ncontact Flickr, get the latest published photos to this web service, and\nsave them in JSON format as a file (flickr_tasks.json), with the same\nstructure as the CSV file (the keys are the same):  1\n2\n3 {   link :   http://www.flickr.com/photos/teleyinex/2945647308/ , \n   url_m :   http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3208/2945647308_f048cc1633_m.jpg ,  \n   url_b :   http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3208/2945647308_f048cc1633_b.jpg   }     Note  Flickr creates from the original image different cropped versions of the image. It uses a pattern to distinguish them:  _m  for medium size, and  _b  for the big ones. There are more options, so if you need more help in this matter, check the official  Flickr    documentation .   As we have a CSV file with some tasks, let s use it for adding some\ntasks to your project. For adding tasks using the CSV file,  all you have to do is the following:  1 pbs add_tasks --tasks-file flickr_tasks.csv   After running this command, you will see a progress bar that will let\nyou know when all the tasks have been added to your project. This has been really easy, right? As you can see, adding tasks to a project is really straightforward if you have a CSV or Excel file. Each row will become a task in PYBOSSA, and you only have to run one command to get all of them into your project.  As a bonus, let s also add some tasks using the  get_images.py  script. This script will contact Flickr, get the last 20 published photos, and then, save them in JSON format into a file called  flickr_tasks.json .  By doing this, we are showing you how you can easily extract data from third-party services and import them into a PYBOSSA project. Thus, let s start by running the command and getting the tasks:  1 python get_images.py   That command has created the file:  flickr_tasks.json . Now, let s use it to add the pictures to our project:  1 pbs add_tasks --tasks-file flickr_tasks.json   Done! Again, a progress bar will show us how long it takes to add all\nthe tasks.

PYBOSSA does not allow the same user to submit more than one\nanswer (task runs in PYBOSSA lingo) to the same task. PYBOSSA identifies anonymous users via their IP, while registered users via their PYBOSSA id.  Why PYBOSSA uses a default value of 30? Well, because we are getting 30 observations for a task, and if the data is normal, at least 30 samples should be obtained to get that model. In any case, you can easily change this value for each, using the task settings section of your project (or via the API using the  pbs  tool).   If you want to improve the quality of the results for one task and get more confidence in the data when you will analyze it, you can modify the redundancy value with the pbs command. For example, to reduce the number of users that will analyze each task to ten, run the following command:  1 pbs add_tasks --tasks-file file --redundancy  10    In this case, the  n_answers  field will instruct PYBOSSA to send the task to 10 different users.",

            "text": "Now that we have set up the  skeleton  to load the task data, let s see\nthe JavaScript that we have to write to load the pictures from\nFlickr and ask the volunteer an answer about them.  All the action takes place in the  file   template.html  script section.  The script is very simple; it uses the PYBOSSA.JS library to get a new task and to submit and save the answer in the server.  PYBOSSA.JS implements two methods that have to be overridden with some logic, as each project will have a different need, i.e., some projects will be loading another type of data in a different skeleton:   pybossa.taskLoaded(function(task, deferred){});  pybossa.presentTask(function(task, deferred){});   The  pybossa.taskLoaded  method will be in charge of adding new  objects to the DOM once they have been loaded from\nFlickr (the URL is provided by the task object in the field\ntask.info.url_b), and resolve the deferred object, so another task for\nthe current user can be pre-loaded. The code is the following:   1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16 pybossa . taskLoaded ( function ( task ,   deferred )   { \n     if   (   ! $ . isEmptyObject ( task )   )   { \n         // load image from flickr \n         var   img   =   $ ( img / ); \n         img . load ( function ()   { \n             // continue as soon as the image is loaded \n             deferred . resolve ( task ); \n         }); \n         img . attr ( src ,   task . info . url_b ). css ( height ,   460 ); \n         img . addClass ( img-polaroid ); \n         task . info . image   =   img ; \n     } \n     else   { \n         deferred . resolve ( task ); \n     }  });    The  pybossa.presentTask  method will be called when a task has been obtained from the server:   1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10 {   question :   project . description , \n   task :   {  \n           id :   value , \n           ..., \n           info :   {  \n                   url_m :  \n                   link : \n                  }  \n         }   }    That JSON object will be accessible via the task object passed as an\nargument to the pybossa.presentTask method. First, we will need to check that we are not getting an empty object, as it will mean that there are no more available tasks for the current user. In that case, we should hide the skeleton, and say thanks to the user as he has participated in all the tasks of the project.  If the task object is not empty, then we have a task to load into the skeleton . In this demo project, we will update the\nquestion, adding the photo to the DOM, refreshing the user progress and add some actions to the submission buttons so we can save the answer of the volunteer.  The PYBOSSA.JS library treats the user input as an  async function. \nThis is why the function gets a deferred object, as this object will be resolved  when the user clicks on one of the possible answers. We use this approach to load in the background the next task for the user while the volunteer is solving the current one. Once the answer has been saved in the server, we resolve the deferred:   1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32 pybossa . presentTask ( function ( task ,   deferred )   { \n     if   (   ! $ . isEmptyObject ( task )   )   { \n         loadUserProgress (); \n         $ ( #photo-link ). html ( ). append ( task . info . image ); \n         $ ( #photo-link ). attr ( href ,   task . info . link ); \n         $ ( #question ). html ( task . info . question ); \n         $ ( #task-id ). html ( task . id ); \n         $ ( .btn-answer ). off ( click ). on ( click ,   function ( evt )   { \n             var   answer   =   $ ( evt . target ). attr ( value ); \n             if   ( typeof   answer   !=   undefined )   { \n                 //console.log(answer); \n                 pybossa . saveTask ( task . id ,   answer ). done ( function ()   { \n                     deferred . resolve (); \n                 }); \n                 $ ( #loading ). fadeIn ( 500 ); \n                 if   ( $ ( #disqus_thread ). is ( :visible ))   { \n                     $ ( #disqus_thread ). toggle (); \n                     $ ( .btn-disqus ). toggle (); \n                 } \n             } \n             else   { \n                 $ ( #error ). show (); \n             } \n         }); \n         $ ( #loading ). hide (); \n     } \n     else   { \n         $ ( .skeleton ). hide (); \n         $ ( #loading ). hide (); \n         $ ( #finish ). fadeIn ( 500 ); \n     }  });    It is important to note that in this method we bind the  on-click \naction for the  Yes ,  No  and  I don t know  buttons to call the above snippet:   1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17 $ ( .btn-answer ). off ( click ). on ( click ,   function ( evt )   { \n     var   answer   =   $ ( evt . target ). attr ( value ); \n     if   ( typeof   answer   !=   undefined )   { \n         //console.log(answer); \n         pybossa . saveTask ( task . id ,   answer ). done ( function ()   { \n             deferred . resolve (); \n         }); \n         $ ( #loading ). fadeIn ( 500 ); \n         if   ( $ ( #disqus_thread ). is ( :visible ))   { \n             $ ( #disqus_thread ). toggle (); \n             $ ( .btn-disqus ). toggle (); \n         } \n     } \n     else   { \n         $ ( #error ). show (); \n     }  });    If your project uses other input methods, you will have to adapt this to fit your project needs.  Finally, the pybossa.presentTask calls a method named loadUserProgress . This method is in charge of getting the user\nthe progress of the user and update the progress bar accordingly:   1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10 function   loadUserProgress ()   { \n     pybossa . userProgress ( flickrperson ). done ( function ( data ){ \n         var   pct   =   Math . round (( data . done * 100 ) / data . total ); \n         $ ( #progress ). css ( width ,   pct . toString ()   + % ); \n         $ ( #progress ). attr ( title ,   pct . toString ()   +   % completed! ); \n         $ ( #progress ). tooltip ({ placement :   left });  \n         $ ( #total ). text ( data . total ); \n         $ ( #done ). text ( data . done ); \n     });  }    You can update the code only to show the number of answers, or remove it entirely. However, the volunteers will benefit from this type of information as they will be able to know how many tasks they have to do, giving an idea of progress while they contribute to the project.  Finally, we only need in our code to tell pybossa.js to run our project:  1 pybossa . run ( flickrperson )",

To submit and save the answer from the user, we will use again\nthe PYBOSSA.JS library. In this case:  1 pybossa . saveTask (   taskid ,   answer   )    The  pybossa.saveTask  method saves an answer for a given task. In the previous section, we show that in the pybossa.presentTask method the  task-id  can be obtained, as we will be passing the object to saveTask method.  The method allows us to give a successful pop-up feedback for the user, so you can use the following structure to warn the user and tell him that his answer has been successfully saved:  1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8 pybossa . saveTask (   taskid ,   answer   ). done ( \n   function (   data   )   { \n       // Show the feedback div \n       $ ( #success ). fadeIn ();  \n       // Fade out the pop-up after a 1000 miliseconds \n       setTimeout ( function ()   {   $ ( #success ). fadeOut ()   },   1000 ); \n   };  );",

The default tutorial does not allow you to curate/create a list of helping materials that could be used directly in the presenter to explain how for example you can identify cancer cells, or specific species of animals.  For this reason, PYBOSSA now supports an API endpoint for helping\nmaterials: api/helpingmaterial.  This endpoint allows you to add JSON and media files (images, videos or sounds) that you can use within your project to build an interactive tutorial.  Helping materials allow you to upload images via the endpoint using the multipart/form-data Content-Type.  For example, imagine that you want to add a photo of an animal and it s description, so users can easily identify it (or use it as pre-loaded\nanswer for classifying pictures of animals).

Then, we create a\nmessages dictionary with all the ids that we want to translate. Finally, we add the languages that we want to support.  As you can see, it s quite simple as you can share the messages object with your volunteers so that you can get many more translations for your project smoothly.  Finally, we need actually to load those translated strings into the\ntemplate. For doing this step, all we ve to do is adding the following\ncode to our  template.html  file at the function pybossa.presentTask:  1\n2\n3\n4\n5 pybossa . presentTask ( function ( task ,   deferred )   { \n     if   (   ! $ . isEmptyObject ( task )   )   { \n         loadUserProgress (); \n         i18n_translate (); \n         ...    Done! When the task is loaded, the strings are translated and the\nproject will be shown in the user language.",

For exporting the data, all you have to do is to visit the following URL\nin your web-browser:  1 http://PYBOSSA-SERVER/project/slug/tasks/export   You will find an interface that will allow you to export the Tasks, Task Runs and Results to  JSON  and  CSV  formats:   The previous methods will export all the tasks, results and task runs,  even if they are not completed . When a task has been completed, in other words, when a task has collected the number of answers specified by the task ( n_answers  = 30 by default), a  brown button  with the text  Download results  will pop up, and if you click it all the answers for the given task will be shown in JSON format.

When you are the owner (or an administrator), a new link in the left local navigation bar of the project will appear with the name \nSettings\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nSettings\n page will give you the following options:\n\n\n\n\nProject details\n: here you will be able to change the name of the\n   project, the description, icon, etc.\n\n\nTask settings\n: this button will open the task-settings page where\n   you will be able to configure the tasks\n scheduler, change the tasks\n priority, modify the tasks\n redundancy and delete the tasks and its associated task runs (also known as answers).\n\n\nProject delete\n: if you click this button you will be able to remove the project from the system entirely. A big warning message will be shown before allowing you to delete the project.\n\n\nProject blog\n: if you click this button, you will be able to write a\n   new blog post to be shared with the volunteers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficial support\n\n\nIf you need help configuring your PYBOSSA server, \ncontact us\n. We offer official support, and we would love to work with your PYBOSSA server.\n\n\n\n\nEdit the project details\n\n\nIn this section you can change the following parameters of your project:\n\n\n\n\nName\n: the full name of your project, i.e., Flickr Person Finder\n\n\nShort name\n: (also known as \nslug\n) the string that will be used\n  to access your project, \nhttp://server/project/short_name\n.\n\n\nDescription\n: A \nshort\n description of the project, e.g., \nImage\n  pattern recognition\n. By default, it will have been autogenerated for you from the \nLong description\n you filled in the previous step (but without the Markdown!).\n\n\nLong Description\n: A \nlong\n description where you can use\n  Markdown to format the description of your project. This field is\n  usually used to provide information about the project, the\n  developer, the researcher group or institutions involved in the\n  project, etc.\n\n\nAllow Anonymous Contributors\n: By default anonymous and\n  authenticated users can participate in all the projects. However, you\n  can change it only to allow authenticated volunteers to participate.\n\n\nPassword\n: If you want to control who can contribute or access to   your project, you can set a password here to share with those you\n  allow to do it. If you leave it blank, then no password will protect your project!\n\n\nCategory\n: Select a category that fits your project. categories\n  are added and managed by the server administrators.\n\n\nWebhook\n: Write here the URL of the server that will handle the \nreal-time data analysis\n of this project\ns tasks.\n\n\nAlso, you will be able to select and upload a \nimage\n from\n  your local computer to set it as the project image throughout the\n  server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask Settings\n\n\nThe \nTask Settings\n is only accessible for the project owner and server administrators. The page can be reached via the \nSettings\n menu, but also from the \nTasks\n link in the left local navigation bar.\n\n\n\n\nThe page shows four different blocks:\n\n\n\n\nTask Scheduler\n: this block allows you to specify how the project should send tasks to the volunteers.\n\n\nTask Priority\n: this block allows you to change the priority of\n   the tasks.\n\n\nTask Redundancy\n: use this block to change the default number of    answers (30 by default) that you want to obtain before marking a\n   task as completed.\n\n\nDelete Tasks\n: this final block allows you to flush all the tasks\n   and its associated task runs (answers).\n\n\n\n\nTask Scheduler\n\n\nPYBOSSA provides different task schedulers that will send tasks to the users in very different ways.\n\n\n\n\nDefault or Depth First\n\n\nThe Default task scheduler (also known as Depth First) has the following features:\n\n\n\n\nIt sends the tasks in the order that were created, first in first\n   out.\n\n\nUsers (anonymous and authenticated) will only be allowed to\n   participate once in the same task. Once a user has submitted a Task\n   Run (or answer) for a given task, the scheduler will never send that\n   task to the same user.\n\n\nIt will send the same task until the task-redundancy is achieved. In\n   other words, if a task has a redundancy value of 3, the task will be\n   always sent until those 3 answers have been submitted. Once the 3\n   answers have been collected, the task will be marked as \ncompleted\n and it will not be sent again.\n\n\nWhen a user has submitted a Task Run for a given task, the scheduler will send to the same user the next task.\n\n\nThis scheduler allows the usage of \norderby\n and \ndesc\n\n   arguments via the \napi/projectID/newtask\n endpoint.\n\n\n\n\nIn summary, from the point of view of a user (authenticated or\nanonymous) the system will be sending the project tasks in the order\nthey were created. If the user tries to reload a task that he or she\nalready participated, the system will detect it, and warn the user\ngiving the option to try with another task (the scheduler will search\nfor the proper task for the given user).\n\n\nFrom the point of view of the project, the scheduler will be trying to\ncomplete (get all the answers requested by the task-redundancy value) all the tasks as soon as possible.\n\n\nDepth First All\n\n\nThe Depth First All scheduler has the following features:\n\n\n\n\nIt sends the tasks in the order that were created, first in first\n   out.\n\n\nUsers (anonymous and authenticated) will only be allowed to\n   participate once in the same task. Once a user has submitted a Task\n   Run (or answer) for a given task, the scheduler will never send that\n   task to the same user.\n\n\nIt does not respect the task state. In other words, if a task has a redundancy value of 3, the task will be always sent even when those 3 answers have been submitted. Once the 3 answers have been collected, the task will be marked as \ncompleted\n and it will be sent again to new users.\n\n\nWhen a user has submitted a Task Run for a given task, the scheduler will send to the same user the next task.\n\n\nThis scheduler allows the usage of \norderby\n and \ndesc\n\n   arguments via the \napi/projectID/newtask\n endpoint.\n\n\n\n\nIn summary, from the point of view of a user (authenticated or\nanonymous) the system will be sending the project tasks in the order\nthey were created. If the user tries to reload a task that he or she\nalready participated, the system will detect it, and warn the user\ngiving the option to try with another task (the scheduler will search\nfor the proper task for the given user).\n\n\nFrom the point of view of the project, the scheduler will be trying to\ncomplete (get all the answers requested by the task-redundancy value) all the tasks as soon as possible allowing new users to participated in completed tasks as well.\n\n\nBreadth First\n\n\nThe Breadth First scheduler has the following features:\n\n\n\n\nIt sends the tasks in the order that were created, first in first\n   out.\n\n\nIt sends always first the task with the least number of task runs in\n   the system.\n\n\n\n\nIn summary, from the point of view of a user (authenticated or\nanonymous) the system will be sending the project\ns tasks that have less answers (in case of not having an answer, the creation time will be used to send them like in a FIFO \nfirst in first out).\n\n\nFrom the point of view of the project, the scheduler will be trying to\nobtain as soon as possible an answer for all the available tasks.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you use the limit and offset, the tasks will be ordered first by the\nnumber of task runs, returning always first the tasks with less number of task runs for the user.\n\n\n\n\nLock\n\n\nThe Lock scheduler has the following features:\n\n\n\n\nIt sends the tasks in the order that were created, first in first\n   out.\n\n\n\n\nWhen a task has been sent, the task will be locked for the user (anonymous or registered) that requested it for 60 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf another user request a task, it will be sent a different task that has not being locked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn summary, from the point of view of a user (authenticated or\nanonymous) the system will be sending the project\ns tasks in order. She will not find any difference from other schedulers.\n\n\nFrom the point of view of the project, the scheduler will be trying to\nsend different tasks to users, spreading the users within all available tasks of the project.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis scheduler does not allow you to request more than 2 tasks at a time to avoid people locking many tasks at once.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis scheduler could be interesting when you hold a workshop and you want everyone participating in a different task\nat the same time.\n\n\n\n\nTask Priority\n\n\nPYBOSSA allows you to prioritize the tasks, or in other words, which\ntasks should be delivered first to the volunteers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nTask Priority is only respected by the default scheduler.\n\n\n\n\nThe page shows you two input boxes:\n\n\n\n\nTask IDs\n: comma separated Task IDs of your project tasks. Note:\n   not spaces between the values or commas.\n\n\nPriority\n: the priority that you want to set for the Task IDs.\n   This must be a value between 0.0 and 1.0.\n\n\n\n\nA task with a priority 1.0 will be the first Task to be delivered to a\ngiven user. In case that two or more tasks have the same priority value, the first task that will be delivered will be the one with the lower Task.ID value.\n\n\nTask Redundancy\n\n\nThe Task Redundancy is a feature that will allow you to analyze\nstatistically, the results that your project are getting for each of its\ntasks.\n\n\nPYBOSSA by default assigns a value of 30 task runs \nanswers\n per task, as this value is commonly used for analyzing the population\nstatistically.\n\n\nThis page will allow you to change the default value, 30, to whatever\nyou like between a minimum of 1 or a maximum of 10000 answers per task. We recommend to have at use at least three answers per task. Otherwise, you will not be able to run a proper analysis on a given task if two users answer differently.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, imagine that the goal of the task is to answer if you see a human in a picture, and the available answers are Yes and No. If you set up the redundancy value to 2, and two different users answer\nrespectively Yes, and No, you will not know the correct answer for the task. By increasing the redundancy value to 5 (or even bigger), you will be able to run a statistical analysis more accurately.\n\n\nDelete Tasks\n\n\nThis section will allow you to complete remove all the Tasks and\nassociated Task Runs (answers) of your project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis step cannot be undone, once you delete all the tasks and associated task runs they will be lost forever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nOnly tasks not associated with a result can be deleted.\n\n\n\n\nThis feature is useful when you are testing your project, and you are\ndeciding the structure that you are going to build in your answers.\n\n\nImport tasks automatically\n\n\nBoth pro users and server administrators can have access to this\nfeature, which allows to schedule a background job that will\nautomatically import tasks every 24 hours. This option is accessible\nfrom the \nTasks\n link in the left local navigation bar:\n\n\n\n\nTasks can be imported using any of the PYBOSSA built-in importers, such as csv-import and epicollect-import. To set up an autoimporter, please refer to the instructions for \nCSV importer\n, \nEpiCollect+ importer\n, \nFlickr importer\n or \nTwitter importer\n, as the procedure is the same:\n\n\n\n\nThe only difference is that the tasks won\nt be imported only once, but regularly, as explained. However, the same behavior should be expected, so auto-importing a CSV file that does not change will result in no new tasks being imported.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe Dropbox, Amazon S3 and Youtube importers are not available for being used as an auto importer.\n\n\n\n\nOnce an auto importer has been set up, it can also be canceled anytime. Just delete it. And a new one can then be created.\n\n\nDelete the project\n\n\nIn case that you want to remove the project and all its tasks, results and task runs, use this section to delete the project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nThis action cannot be undone. Be sure before proceeding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\nOnly projects without results can be deleted.\n\n\n\n\nAdding co-owners to your project\n\n\nJob creators have the ability to add co-owners to jobs that they create. The co-owner will be able to view/edit the task presenter code on a job, as well as change the task settings and upload tasks. To do this, go to\nsettings -\n  manage co-owners\n\n\nOnce there, you are able to type in the username of the person that you want to add as a co-owner, click on Search, and then click on \u201cAdd Co-Owner\u201d.\n\n\n\n\nThe new co-owner will appear in the project co-owners list. Project co-owners (with the exception of the original project creator) can also be removed from here.\n\n\n\n\nTransfer project ownership\n\n\nYou can transfer the project ownership to another user in the PYBOSSA server.\n\n\nFor changing the ownership, just add the email of the user that you want to make the new owner.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you are not an admin of PYBOSSA, you cannot undo this action, and you will not be able to modify/change settings of the project as you will not be the owner anymore. Admins, however, can change the ownership always.\n\n\n\n\nGenerate project report\n\n\nYou can generate project report in csv form that provides consolidated status of your project. This report has project and user statistics sections. Project section lists information on project id, project short name, total tasks in project, time when first and last task was submitted and average time spent on each task in minutes. User statistics section lists information on contributors id, name, full name, total tasks completed, percentage of tasks completed and time when first and last task submission were submitted by the contributor.\n\n\nThe report can be generated from \nExport Project Report\n option under project settings page.",

For doing this task, you can do it offline, with our \nEnki\n software, or take advantage\nof the PYBOSSA webhooks feature.\n\n\nPYBOSSA webhooks is a notification system, that will send an HTTP POST request to another server of your\nchoice, sending the following data:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n{\nfired_at\n:,\n\n \nproject_short_name\n:\n \nproject-slug\n,\n\n \nproject_id\n:\n \n1,\n\n \ntask_id\n:\n \n1,\n\n \nresult_id\n:\n \n1,\n\n \nevent\n:\n \ntask_completed\n}\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the data specifies which task has been completed, when, and which \nempty\n result has been\ncreated for you. In this way, you can ask Enki to download the task, its associated task runs and do the statistical\nanalysis in real time. Moreover, as PYBOSSA creates an empty result for you, you can use again enki to POST the\nstatistical analysis back to PYBOSSA, so you can then search through the API for example for all the pictures classified\nas red.\n\n\nIn order to simplify your workflow, we have created a small microservice named \nwebhooks\n, that gives you the basics to start.\n\n\nWhile the main purpose of this microservice is to do the analysis of the results,\nyou can customize and fork it to do other things like:\n\n\n\n\nPost to Twitter that your project has completed a task.\n\n\nUpload the results to your DropBox folder by writing the results in a file.\n\n\nCreate a new task in another project, because the statistics met a given criteria.\n\n\nSend an email with the result as an attachment, and in the body of the email the statistical analysis.\n\n\nGive badges to users that correctly answered the task.\n\n\netc.\n\n\n\n\nThe template that we provide, only shows how you can easily \nget the most voted option for an image pattern recognition project.\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nTo install the microservice all you need is to run the following command (we recommend\nyou to use a virtual environment):\n\n\n1\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nClone or \ndownload\n the software before proceed.\n\n\n\n\nNow, copy the settings.py.template file to: \nsettings.py\n and fill in the\ninformation. Once you are done with this file, you\nll be ready to run the\nserver.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nBe sure to have a PYBOSSA API-KEY as the analysis will be stored in the \nPYBOSSA results table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIt requires a PYBOSSA server \n= 1.2.0.\n\n\n\n\nRunning the microservice\n\n\nNow that you\nve the required libraries installed, running the server is as\nsimple as this:\n\n\n1\npython app.py\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, copy the domain or IP and port where it\ns running and save that address in your\nproject\ns settings page, in the webhooks field. PYBOSSA will check if the webhooks server\nis running. If it is not, it will fail and it will not allow you to save the URL.\n\n\nConfiguring background jobs\n\n\nBy default, this project has disabled the creation of queues in your system. If\nyou expect to have lots of contributions in your project, we recommend you to\nenable them.\n\n\nTo support queues you will need to install in your machine a Redis server.\nThen, change the flag: \nenable_background_jobs\n to True in your settings.py\nfile, and restart the server. \n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you are already running a Redis server and queues, you can customize\nthe name of your queue in the settings file. Check out the config variable:\n\nqueue_name\n.\n\n\n\n\nRunning the background jobs\n\n\nNow that you have the project running background jobs, you need to process\nthem. This is very simple, in another terminal run the following command:\n\n\n1\nrqworker mywebhooks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you\nve changed the name of the queue, please, update the previous\ncommand with your new queue name.

In this way, you will be able to fix your code, without having to stop your project.\n\n\nGo to your webhooks project section, and check the available options.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nPYBOSSA sends you a \nrerun\n argument when doing the POST if you use any of the previous options,\nso you can handle that specific case in your code. All you have to do is check for that argument in\nthe POST.\n\n\n\n\nCreating missing webhooks\n\n\nSometimes, you might start your project without the webhooks solution in mind. This will lead to a project\nwhere you have several completed tasks, without any associated webhooks. This is because you didn\nt enabled the\nwebhooks solution, and therefore PYBOSSA didn\nt created it for you.\n\n\nFor those cases, you can use the cli.py script. It has a specific command that will allow you to create all\nthe missing webhooks in one row. For doing it, all you need is your project ID and then run the following command:\n\n\n1\npython cli.py create_webhooks projectID\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, from your project, enable the webhooks server, and you will only have to hit the button re-run all webhooks.\nThis action, will enqueue all the webhooks and you will get your data analysis done!",

These methods will not work with the rest of the PYBOSSA endpoints, as that only support GET and POST actions.\n\n\nGetting data\n\n\nYou can get a specific domain object by its id (by default any GET action will return only 20 objects, you can get more or fewer objects using the \nlimit\n option):\n\n\n1\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/{domain-object}/{id}[?api_key=API-KEY]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nSome GET actions may require to authenticate \n authorize the request.

You will use the objects attributes to filter the query, as it will return only objects matching it:\n\n\n1\nGET http://pybossa-site-url/api/{domain-object}[?domain-object-field=value]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple fields can be used separated by the \n symbol:\n\n\n1\nGET http://pybossa-site-url/api/{domain-object}[?field1=value\nfield2=value2]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is possible to limit the number of returned objects:\n\n\n1\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/{domain-object}[?field1=value\nlimit=20]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiltering info keys for PYBOSSA versions up to v2.8.X\n\n\nIt is possible to access first level JSON keys within the \ninfo\n field\nof Categories, Projects, Tasks, Task Runs and Results:\n\n\n1\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/{domain-object}[?field1=value\ninfo=foo::bar\nlimit=20]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo search within the first level (nested keys are not supported), you\nhave to use the following format:\n\n\n1\ninfo=key::value\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor adding more keys:\n\n\n1\ninfo=key1::value1|key2::value2|keyN::valueN\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese parameters will be ANDs, so, it will return objects that have\nthose keys with and \nand\n operator.\n\n\nFiltering info keys for PYBOSSA \n= 2.9.1 (or master branch)\n\n\nSince version v2.9.0, PYBOSSA stores JSON data as JSONB within the database.\n\n\nThis feature allows us to use new queries, like path searching via the API.\n\n\nYou can now search like this:\n\n\n1\n2\ninfo={\nkey1\n: value}\ninfo={\nkey1\n: [{\nkey2\n: value}]}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou specify the JSON path and the values, and the system will return those that meet\nthat criteria. This new feature allows you to filter nested data without any problems.\n\n\nIf you are not storing a dictionary, {}, in the info field, you will need to quote your\nstring, so the sytem can handle it properly. If you are storing a number, instead of a\nstring, then you should use \n9\n double quotes. This applies to integers and floats.\n\n\nYour data first\n\n\nThe API understands who is requesting the data. When you are using your API key to authenticate your calls, the system will return only your data. For instance, if you request all the projects, you will only get \nyour projects\n and the rest (owned by other users will be hidden).  You can get access to all the projects, tasks, and task runs (the whole database) using the parameter: \nall=1\n.\n\n\nFor example, if an anonymous user accesses the generic API endpoints like:\n\n\n1\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/project\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will return all the projects from the DB, ordering them by ID. If you\naccess it like authenticating yourself:\n\n\n1\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/project?api_key=YOURKEY\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, you will get your projects. In other words, the\nprojects that you own. If you don\nt have a project, but you want to\nexplore the API then you can use the \nall=1\n argument:\n\n\n1\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/project?api_key=YOURKEY\nall=1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis call will return all the projects from the DB ordering by ID.\n\n\nFor example, you can get a list of your Projects like this:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/project\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/project?api_key=YOURKEY\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/project?api_key=YOURKEY\nall=1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr a list of available Categories:\n\n\n1\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/category\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr a list of Tasks:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/task\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/task?api_key=YOURKEY\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/task?api_key=YOURKEY\nall=1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a list of TaskRuns use:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/taskrun\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/taskrun?api_key=YOURKEY\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/taskrun?api_key=YOURKEY\nall=1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing date ranges\n\n\nIf you want, you can use the domain attribute \ncreated\n to get items from the DB. You can specify a year, year-month, year-month-day to get all the values for those ranges. For example, if you want all the tasks that have been created in 2015, just use:\n\n\n1\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/task?created=2015\nall=1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want all the task runs from 2015-05:\n\n\n1\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/taskrun?created=2015-05\nall=1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can, for example, get all the task runs that a user has submitted on a given day like this:\n\n\n1\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/taskrun?created=2015-05-03\nuser_id=3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis filter works for any object that has the \ncreated\n attribute.\n\n\nOrder by\n\n\nAny query can be ordered by an attribute of the domain object that you are querying. For example, you can get a list of tasks ordered by ID:\n\n\n1\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/task?orderby=id\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want, you can order them in descending order:\n\n\n1\nGET http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/task?orderby=id\ndesc=true\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck all the attributes that you can use to order by in the \nDomain\nObject section\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nPlease, notice that to keep users privacy, only their locale and nickname will be shared by default. Optionally, users can disable privacy mode in their settings. By doing so, also their full name and account creation date will be visible for everyone through the API.\n\n\n\n\nLimit\n\n\nBy default, PYBOSSA limits the list of items to 20. If you want to get more items, use the keyword \nlimit=N\n with \nN\n being a number to get that amount. There is a maximum of 100 to the \nlimit\n keyword, so if you try to get more items at once, it won\nt work.\n\n\nPagination\n\n\nYou can paginate the results of any GET query using the last ID of the domain object that you have received and the parameter:     \nlast_id\n. For example, to get the next 20 items after the last   project ID that you\nve received, you will write the query like this:\n\n\n1\n`GET /api/project?last_id=N.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPagination with offset and limit\n\n\nDEPRECATED (see next Note for a better and faster solution)\n  You can use the keyword \noffset=N\n in any \nGET\n query to skip that many rows before beginning to get rows. If both \noffset\n and \nlimit\n appear, then \noffset\n rows are skipped before starting to count the \nlimit\n rows that are returned.\n\n\n\n\nRelated data\n\n\nFor Tasks, TaskRuns, and Results you can get the associated data using the argument: \nrelated=True\n.\n\n\nThis flag will allow you to get in one call all the TaskRuns and Result\nfor a given task. You can do the same for a TaskRun getting the Task and associated Result, and for a Result getting all the TaskRuns and\nassociated Task.\n\n\nProjects do not have this feature, as it will be too expensive for the\nAPI.\n\n\nProject stats\n\n\nFor Projects, you can get the associated statistics using the argument: \nstats=True\n.\n\n\nThis will add the statistics, such as overall progress, number of tasks etc.,\nagainst the \nstats\n key for each project.\n\n\nCreate\n\n\nCreate a domain object. Returns created domain object.:\n\n\n1\nPOST http://{pybossa-site-url}/api/{domain-object}[?api_key=API-KEY]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nSome POST actions may require to authenticate \n authorize the request.

Use the following header:  X-CSRFToken.  As this endpoint supports  two  different forms, you must specify\nwhich form are you targeting adding an extra key:  btn . The options\nfor this key are:   Upload : to update the  upload_form .   The other one does not need this extra key.   Note  Be sure to respect the Uppercase in the first letter. Otherwise, it will fail.   It returns a JSON object with the following information:   flash : A success message, or error indicating if the request was\n    successful.  form : the form fields with the sent information. It contains the\n    csrf token for validating the post, as well as an errors field in    the case that something is wrong.

If\nyou  are using jQuery, set it to False, so the file is handled properly.\nTo still recieve a JSON response you can add the response_format=json query\nparamater to your request.  The (x1,x2,y1,y2) are the coordinates for cutting the image and create\nthe avatar.  (x1,y1) are the offset left of the cropped area and the offset top of the cropped area respectively; and (x2,y2) are the width and height of the crop. And don t forget to add an extra key to the form-data:  btn  with a value Upload to select this form.",

Therefore,  \nif you are going to use this method to deploy a PYBOSSA production server\n \nit is your responsibility to secure the system properly\n.\n\n\n\n\nSetting up PYBOSSA with Vagrant\n\n\nTo start using Vagrant and PYBOSSA all you have to do is\ninstalling the following open source software:\n\n\n\n\nVirtualBox\n (min version 4.2.10)\n\n\nVagrant\n (min version 1.2.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nVagrant\n and \nVirtualBox\n works in Windows, GNU/Linux, and Mac OS X, so you can try and run PYBOSSA without problems!\n\n\n\n\nClone the PYBOSSA git repository (be sure to install git in your\nmachine!):\n\n\n1\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/Scifabric/pybossa.git\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have downloaded the source code, all you have to do to start your PYBOSSA development environment is typing the following in a terminal:\n\n\n1\n2\ncd\n pybossa\nvagrant up\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe system will download a Virtual Machine, install all the required\nlibraries for PYBOSSA and set up the system for you inside the virtual machine.\n\n\nVagrant is great because all the changes that you will make in\nyour local copy of PYBOSSA will be automatically populated to the\nVirtual Machine. Hence, if you add a new feature to the system, you will be able to test it right away (this feature is pretty handy for\nworkshops, hackfests, etc.).\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you don\nt have enough space in your hard disk, Vagrant will fail to set up the virtual machine. For solving this issue\njust, modify the VirtualBox path to point to a partition or disk that has enough space. You can then manually change it with\nthis command: VBoxManage setproperty machinefolder to/new/path\n\n\n\n\nRunning the PYBOSSA server\n\n\nNow that all the libraries and dependencies have been installed, you can lunch the PYBOSSA development server:\n\n\n1\n2\nvagrant ssh\npython run.py\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nVirtualenv (located in /home/vagrant/pybossa-env) is always activated on  login.\n\n\n\n\nNow all you have to do is open the following URL in your web browser: \nhttp://127.0.0.1:5000\n\n\nAnd you are done! Happy Hacking \n!\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nPYBOSSA needs a RQ worker process. It is running by default permanently in the background in the VM and is controlled by supervisor. Optional is also the RQ scheduler process for speeding up tasks like ZIP creation. This process is off by default now. If you are developing on RQ worker, you want to restart or disable it with supervisorctl.",

Clone the PYBOSSA git repository (be sure to install git in your\nmachine!):  1 git clone --recursive https://github.com/Scifabric/pybossa.git   Once you have downloaded the source code, all you have to do to start your PYBOSSA development environment is typing the following in a terminal:  1\n2 cd  pybossa\nvagrant up   The system will download a Virtual Machine, install all the required\nlibraries for PYBOSSA and set up the system for you inside the virtual machine.  Vagrant is great because all the changes that you will make in\nyour local copy of PYBOSSA will be automatically populated to the\nVirtual Machine. Hence, if you add a new feature to the system, you will be able to test it right away (this feature is pretty handy for\nworkshops, hackfests, etc.).   Note  If you don t have enough space in your hard disk, Vagrant will fail to set up the virtual machine. For solving this issue\njust, modify the VirtualBox path to point to a partition or disk that has enough space. You can then manually change it with\nthis command: VBoxManage setproperty machinefolder to/new/path",

Now all you have to do is open the following URL in your web browser:  http://127.0.0.1:5000  And you are done! Happy Hacking  !   Note  PYBOSSA needs a RQ worker process. It is running by default permanently in the background in the VM and is controlled by supervisor. Optional is also the RQ scheduler process for speeding up tasks like ZIP creation. This process is off by default now. If you are developing on RQ worker, you want to restart or disable it with supervisorctl.",

In order to improve this security, PYBOSSA (v2.9.5) \nencodes the IP address using the technique \nCryptography-based  Prefix-preserving Anonymization\n to\nensure that all IPs are anonymous.\n\n\nTherefore when downloading results or a project task run, you won\u00b4t get the real user IP as all of them have \nbeen made anonymous.\n\n\nWe use the following \nPython module\n to perform this task.\n\n\nForget me (or delete your account)\n\n\nPYBOSSA now allows any user (without a project) to delete his/her own account. This action cannot be undone.\n\n\nWhen users deletes their account, PYBOSSA will:\n\n\n\n\nAnonymize their task runs. The user_id will be removed, and for each task run PYBOSSA will generates a fake IP address, so that it is not possible to know what users have sent to the server.\n\n\nIf the server is using Mailchimp integration, PYBOSSA will delete the user from the Mailchimp list sholuld the user subscribed to it.\n\n\nDelete all personal data from the server (DB).\n\n\nEmail to the user and the server administrator so that the user knows everything has been deleted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf the server is using DISQUS SSO, PYBOSSA will note in the removal confirmation email that \n- as of the 10\nth\n of May 2018, DISQUS does not provide an API method to delete the user account. \nTherefore, PYBOSSA will inform the user that he/she will have to delete their DISQUS account.\n\n\n\n\nExport your own data\n\n\nFrom your personal PYBOSSA account you will be able to export the following data in list of zip files:\n\n\n\n\nAll your personal data\n\n\nAll your projects created by you\n\n\nAll your contributions (task runs)\n\n\n\n\nPYBOSSA will create a ZIP file and send an email with links to your email. Those links will only be valid\nfor 3 days - default configuration, after that they will be removed.\n\n\nThese ZIP files have your data in JSON format, so you can view it with any text editor - standard format.\n\n\nSee all my data\n\n\nYou can get all your data first, so you can see it with any text editor in any platform. \n\n\nRestrict processing\n\n\nIf you don\nt want to delete your account, but you want to restrict processing you can do that from your\nuser\ns profile page. Just go to your settings, hit the update link and there check the \nrestrict processing\n checkbox.\n\n\nThis will ensure that no one access your data, not even the admins. By checking that box, you will be completely removed\nfrom the user API (only you can access your account under your ID), your User is not going to be part of the api USER filtering,\nyou are not included in any leaderboard (including top 5 users for projects, and active users in the last 24 hours).\n\n\nMigrating from a PYBOSSA server version \n v2.9.5\n\n\nIf your server is running a version smaller than v2.9.5 you will need to upgrade the \nserver to the latest version in order to be GDPR compliant. You then have to anonymize\nyour stored IPs. PYBOSSA provides a script for doing this task:\n\n\n1\n  python cli.py anonymize_ips\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have custom leaderboards, then, you will have to drop those materialized views by hand. Why?\nBecause we\nre adding a new column to them. If you only use the default leaderboard, everything should\nwork as expected. To delete your materialized views for your leaderboards, just run this command within\nthe DB:\n\n\n1\n  \ndrop\n \nmaterialized\n \nview\n \nusers_rank_\n{\nyour_name\n}\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplace the {} text with your names, and you will be fine. This will not delete any data, as the materialized\nviews will be recreated by the jobs in the next tick. If you need them recreated now, just open a terminal and\nrun the following command:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\nfrom\n \nrun\n \nimport\n \ncreate_app\n\n\nfrom\n \npybossa.leadeboard.jobs\n \nimport\n \nleaderboard\n\n\n\napp\n \n=\n \ncreate_app\n(\nFalse\n)\n\n\n\nwith\n \napp\n.\napp_context\n():\n\n   \nleaderboard\n(\ninfo\n=\nyour_name\n)\n\n   \nleaderboard\n(\ninfo\n=\nyour_second\n)\n\n   \n...\n\n   \nleaderboard\n(\ninfo\n=\nyour_n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat will recreate the views for you, and you will be ready to use them.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nWe strongly recommend you to do a backup before running the upgrade and the migration of the DB.\n\n\n\n\nLastly you will have to unsubscribe all your users from project updates. PYBOSSA has a DB migration\nfor achiving it. Just run the following command:\n\n\n1\n  alembic upgrade head\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will ensure that all your users are unsubscribed, and they can now subscribe if they want.",

To delete your materialized views for your leaderboards, just run this command within\nthe DB:  1    drop   materialized   view   users_rank_ { your_name } ;    Replace the {} text with your names, and you will be fine.

We will try to help you and\nadd your question to the FAQ.\n\n\n\n\nUsers\n\n\nDo I need to create an account to participate in the project?\n\n\nIt depends. The owners of the projects can disable anonymous\ncontributions (usually due to privacy issues with the data), forcing you\nto create an account if you want to contribute to that specific project.\n\n\nProjects\n\n\nHow can I create a project?\n\n\nYou can create a project using web forms, or if you prefer it using the\nAPI. We recommend you to read the user/overview and user/tutorial\nsections.\n\n\nCan I disable anonymous contributions?\n\n\nYes, you can. Check your project settings and toggle the drop down menu:\n\nAllow Anonymous Contributors\n from Yes to No. Check the project-details\nfor further information.\n\n\nCan I create \ngolden tasks\n?\n\n\nYes, you can. PYBOSSA has a field for every Task named: \ncalibration\n\nthat will identify the task as a \ngolden\n task or as we call them as a\n\ncalibration task\n. Calibration tasks can be used to weight the answers\nof the volunteers (authenticated and anonymous) as you know the answer\nfor those given tasks. For example, if a user has answered all the\ncalibration tasks correctly you can give a weight of 1 point to all\nhis/her answers, while if the user only answered 50% of them correctly,\nthe answers for the rest of the tasks could be given a weight of 0.5\npoints.\n\n\nCan I delete my project and all the task and task runs?\n\n\nYes, you can. If you are the owner of the project you can delete the\nproject, and automatically all the task and associated task runs will be\ndeleted (\nnote\n: this cannot be undone!). Check the project-delete\nsection for further details.\n\n\nIf I\nve installed the server, can I run a script to reset a project?\n\n\nYes, you can. You will have to access the server, and then run the command\n\n\n1\n   \npython\n \ncli\n.\npy\n \nclean_project\n \nProjectID\n \nSkipTasks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.. note:\n   By default, if you run this command it will return all the tasks,\n   task_runs, results and reset all the statistics for that project. \n   BE CAREFUL.\n\n\nPass ProjectID to delete everything, or tell the command to skip deleting\nthe tasks, so you can keep them, and update the stats accordingly.\n\n\nDo you provide any statistics about the users for my project?\n\n\nYes, every project has its own statistics page that shows information\nabout the distribution of answers per type of user, an estimation about\nhow long it will take to complete all your tasks, the top 5\nauthenticated and anonymous users, etc. Check the \nStatistics\n link in\nthe left local sidebar of your project.\n\n\nMy project is not getting too much attention, how can it be a \nfeatured\n project?\n\n\nFeatured projects are managed by the administrators of the site. Contact\nthem about this issue, and they will decide about your project.\n\n\nI have all my data in a CSV file, can I import it?\n\n\nYes, you can. PYBOSSA supports the CSV format, so all you have to do is\nupload your file to a file server like DropBox, copy the public link and\npaste it in the importer section. PYBOSSA also supports Google Drive\nSpreadsheets, see csv-import section for further details.\n\n\nMy data is in a Google Doc Spreadsheet, can I import the data into my project?\n\n\nYes, you can. PYBOSSA supports the Google Drive Spreadsheets, so make it\npublic, copy the link and use that link to import it the Google Drive\nimporter section. See csv-import section for further details.\n\n\nAll my tasks have been completed, how do I download the results to analyze them?\n\n\nYou can export all the data of your project whenever you want. The data\ncan be exported directly from the \nTasks\n section (check the \nTasks\n\nlink in the left sidebar of your project and click in the export box).\nPYBOSSA can export your tasks and task runs (or answers) to a CSV file,\nJSON format or to a CKAN server. See the export-results section for\nfurther details.\n\n\nWhat is a Task Run?\n\n\nA Task Run is a submitted answer sent by one user (authenticated or\nanonymous) to one of the tasks of your project. In other words, it is\nthe work done by one volunteer for one task.\n\n\nWhat is the Task Presenter?\n\n\nThe task presenter is the web project that will load the tasks of your\nproject and present them to the user. It is an HTML + JavaScript\nproject. See the task-presenter section for further details.\n\n\nPYBOSSA\n\n\nDoes PYBOSSA have an API?\n\n\nYes, it does. PYBOSSA has a api that allows you to create projects,\ndownload results, import tasks, etc. Please see the api section for more\ndetails and the user/tutorial for a full example about how you can use\nit.\n\n\nIs PYBOSSA open-source?\n\n\nYes, it is. PYBOSSA is licensed under the \nGNU Affero general public\nlicense version 3.0\n.\n\n\nDo you provide project templates or examples projects?\n\n\nYes, we do.

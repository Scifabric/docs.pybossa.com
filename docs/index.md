# Welcome to PYBOSSA's documentation

PYBOSSA is a technology developed by [Scifabric](https://scifabric.com).
It is used for the development of platforms and data collection within
collaborative environments, analysis and data enrichment.

PYBOSSA is an extremely flexible and versatile technology with a
multitude of applications that adapt to each specific case facilitating
many of the daily tasks that take place in research environments such as
museums, art galleries, heritage institutions, libraries of any kind,
market research companies, hospitals, universities and all those
organisations that manage data or require information from their
customers/users -such as airports, shopping malls, banks, hotel chains,
etc.

PYBOSSAâ€™s simplicity consists in its easy adjustment to any areas using
any of the available templates, this way every customer can then adapt
it to their own needs.

PYBOSSA can import data directly from other products such as Amazon
S3, Youtube, Google Spreadsheets, Raspberry Pi, etc.
Through all these integrations PYBOSSA allows data capture for further
analysis made by users in a transparent and easy way.

# PYBOSSA for python 3

We've finally migrated PYBOSSA to python 3. We're not going to merge into master until we test it in production a bit
more, so please, help us by testing it. All you have to do is basically, check out the python3 branch (migrate-python3) and run
it. Then, any bug, issue you find, you just report it and we will be happy to help you.

# Google, Twitter and Facebook accounts

We've officially dropped support for login using social networks. We will only support local based accounts, and you can still use the external_user ID for
managing those accounts if you want. There's script in the cli.py file that allows you to migrate your social media accounts into local ones.
